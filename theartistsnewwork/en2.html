<p align="center">The Emperor's New Clothes</p>
<p>Many years ago, there was an art student who was so very fond of art that he spent all of his time in art. He was not a social animal and did not have too many friends. He did not care to go to the bar like his schoolmates. He only went out to have meals when somebody invited him to discuss art. He invested all his energy in thinking about making art. Most of his peers were still seemed to be students while he was seemed to be a real artist.</p>
<p>One day, a young man who claimed himself as his schoolmate came to his studio. That one said that he appreciated his works and want to collaborate with him to make a real masterpiece. This piece should have the most delicate and subtle design which would be difficult to perceive by the majority who didn&rsquo;t understand art and who had bad taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These must, indeed, be a wonderful opportunity to make a piece which I am always thinking about but still have no idea about.&rdquo; Thought that art student. &ldquo;If I could collaborate with him, I might make that dream piece come true. I would not only be able to figure out who don&rsquo;t understand art and aesthetic but also help myself to understand the essence of art. We should start work on that immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the new-coming one took out his laptop, opened a new document. He said they should start to devote themselves into the research as soon as possible. Making art is not to present a final work but the whole process should be regarded as a piece of art as well. He totally agreed with that theory and started to work with his new friend immediately until late at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could this piece be in the end,&rdquo; thought that student. When he remembered that the majority of people would not get the subtlety of that piece he began to be a little bit nervous and self-suspicious. To be sure, he thought he should believe his talent and taste. However, he would prefer inviting somebody to look at and talk about this piece. All the classmates had heard of that he started to collaborate with another student. All of them wanted to know what exactly they were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should invite my professor to give us some helpful advice,&rdquo; said the student at last. &ldquo;He will be best able to give some constructive opinions to us. He is always serious during critiques and points out the problems directly. No one can be better for his job than he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he invited that old wise professor to his studio. After the professor arriving, he saw the extremely clean and empty studio and two students were working in front of their laptops and discussing something. &ldquo;What can be the meaning of this?&rdquo; thought the old professor, opening his eyes very wide. &ldquo;I cannot see anything in their studio. So, what should I look at?&rdquo; The professor felt confused and standing beside them didn&rsquo;t speak out his thought aloud.</p>
<p>That student noticed the professor and asked him very kindly to be so good as to come nearer their desk. They told the professor very frankly not only about their ambition but also their trouble of being stuck. Then they asked the professor for his opinion about how could such a project come true. The professor thought and thought, feeling their idea quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could that be possible?&rdquo; thought he again. &ldquo;Or are they meaning to try to be irony to ridicule the contemporary art? Maybe… Maybe I could suggest some absurdist and postmodernist theory with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; that student asked again, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very ambitious but a little bit confusing…&rdquo; replied the old professor, cupped his chin with his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure about what specific thing you want to do. But actually, I am pretty sure that I perceived a kind of irony and sarcastic characters of what you are talking about. Have you ever seen works of absurdism and some related postmodernist theory?  Samuel Beckett and Peter Handke&rsquo;s works will be helpful for you to research.<br>
              <br>
  &ldquo;Definitely, this is exactly what we will going to.&rdquo; said the student. Then they talked about their understanding of the relationship between theater and postmodernism. They went on working in the studio with as much effort as before.</p>
<p>That student soon invited another professor to give some feedback on their process. It seemed like they still could not take their thought into proper practice which could convey their ambition. These professors felt a little bit embarrassed and confused when they heard their thought. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about our concept?&rdquo; asked the student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These students always make something makes people hard to talk about,&rdquo; thought the professor, &ldquo;How could that kind of work be possible? Or are they preforming the awkwardness now? Is this a project about doing nothing? Huh…&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, he talked about this kind of feeling of ambiguity and suggested them maybe the awkwardness and nothingness could have very potentiality to make a piece about. &ldquo;It definitely could be very subtle and interesting as you proposed at the beginning&rdquo; One professor said, &ldquo;Keep working!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole class was talking about that mystic work. While other&rsquo;s progress was very clear, they seemed to have made a lot of effort as well as did nothing at all.</p>
<p>Finally, when the final presentation was coming, the self-suspicion of that student became much more intense. He wished to look at this work from an objective, neutral perspective and talk about his self-suspicion and entanglement with some other faculties including who had already talked with them. When the professors arrived, they saw these two students frowning with loath faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should we look at or talk about this time?&rdquo; thought the two who had saw this piece before. &ldquo;To be honest, we felt a little bit unconfident and self-suspicious now.&rdquo; Their faces turned red. It was clear that they were really nervous. All the people present could felt the awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said the student to himself. &ldquo;What exactly we did? Or have we already created something that is beyond our own understanding? —Oh! What do you think about this?&rdquo; asked he reluctantly. He seemed like do not know where to look at. The professors felt embarrassed as well. Everyone seemed to be witnessing a great drama as well as nothing and trying to say something but the sense of ambiguity even generated self-suspicion in themselves and shut their mouth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, time would not stop because of that awkwardness. &ldquo;Maybe you guys can make a presentation of this project in the final critique.&rdquo; A professor suggested.  &ldquo;Whatever you have done or thought, present it systematically to us and your peers. This unspoken uncomfortableness deserves discussion.&rdquo; They seemed to relieve for now, however, postponing the embarrassment could not help resolve the knot in their mind. </p>
<p>Time flew. They sat up the whole of the night before the final critique. They kept working while their classmates backed to home one by one. They stared at their screens, typed on the keyboards and discussed something. Next day morning, two artists sat in the presentation space anxiously. It seemed like they were prepared to be the first group to start the presentation day. They looked at each other, at last.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Maybe the work is ready for the final critique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them stood up and went to operate the projection. The other one opened his laptop and talked to his partner in a low voice. &ldquo;You may deal with the projection and I will be responsible for the talking. The whole thing looks like nothing…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they setting up their presentation? It sounds weird…&rdquo; thought one of their classmates who heard about this piece before. </p>
<p>The first slide was shown. The title of the famous story — <em>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes</em> — was projected on the wall. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is what it is. Now it turns to be quite interesting.&rdquo; thought one professor who had participated last discussion. &ldquo;What a surprise.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello everyone, we are ready to present a short story to you,&rdquo; said our protagonist.</p>
<p>Both those professors and their classmates looked at the serious faces of our artists and smiled. Those who felt bored and was playing their smart phones also put down their devices and got ready to watch their reading performance.</p>
<p>One of them controlled the computer and started to play the slide. The other one started to read out. &ldquo;<em>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes</em>. Many years ago…&rdquo; All the audience laughed. &ldquo;Oh! This is quite smart to put this story here in such a period when the authenticity is dismissed while fakeness and nothingness are dominating.&rdquo; Most people started to prepare their feedback after the presentation. Mostly focus on the critique of discourse, power, knowledge and elitism. No one would not admit the subtlety which seemed ridiculous when two artists addressed at the very beginning, which, by the way, also made everyone become the person who understood art with good taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a second. This is not <em>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes.</em>&rdquo; thought one classmate who noticed the first paragraph what the artist was reading was not about the emperor. &ldquo;This is another story!&rdquo; others also noted that after a few seconds. They stopped thinking about their idea for later discussion and listened to the story carefully. Two artists collaborated pretty well, however, the one who was reading even was trembling a little bit. The language on the paper seemed to be familiar as well as strange to him. However, he thought he had to finish this work completely otherwise there would be nothing to be critiqued later. As a result, he sat up and kept reading in an almost mechanical way. When the artist turned to the last page, the piece seemed to be close to its true ending very soon.<br>
