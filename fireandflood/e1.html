<p align="center">Fire and Flood</p>
<p>            Tonight, when I came back to my home with my parents, I felt that the atmosphere was very strange. Some of my neighbors gathered outside of the building. When we looked closer, the scene in the building shocked us a lot. The floor was flooded by water! What happened here? The story should be started from last night.<br>
  <br>
              It was nine o&rsquo;clock when I came back from the mall with my parent last night. We saw two policemen on the first floor. Then they took the lift with us and pressed the 11th. I felt a little bit afraid. I started to wonder if something bad happened on the 11th floor? I didn&rsquo;t feel better even though I backed to my room.<br>
  <br>
              My parents also concerned about that. After a while, my dad went out and tried to figure out what happened. The truth freaked us out. There was a fire at a grandpa&rsquo;s apartment on the 11th! The fireman had just arrived. After hearing that, I went downstairs with my mom in a hurry. Our neighbors told us the reason for the fire was that the grandpa was boiling the water and the water was boiled away but he didn&rsquo;t notice that immediately. The fire even burnt parts of his eyebrows! Fortunately, the firemen arrived very quickly, which prevent a big disaster…<br>
  <br>
              Now somebody must have some questions. Why do you bring up the fire? Where is the flood? The lift didn&rsquo;t work and we must use the stairs which were covered with water. What exactly happened now? It turned out to be a mistake made by the firemen who came to fight the fire last night. They didn&rsquo;t shut the fire hydrant after using it and the water kept coming out from it, which caused the flood. The fireman came to fight the fire last night and then they should come to fight the flood tonight.<br>
  <br>
            A fire and a flood happened in two days, which was so unfortunate. We should learn a lesson from these two accidents. No matter in our daily life or in the society, we should pay attention to every detail and be really careful to prevent these kinds of disaster and make our life and society better! </p>
