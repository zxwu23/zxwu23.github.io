<p align="center">Fire and Flood</p>
<p>            Friday night, I came back to my home with my parents from a mall by a taxi. We saw two policemen when we arrived at the gate. They took the lift with us and they were going to the 9th floor. I started to wondered if there were some bad people coming?<br>
  <br>
              My family started to talk about that as soon as we came inside…When my dad went out to detect what happened, he found that there were two fire engines in front of the gate. He told us immediately. My grandma, mom and I left our room to see and my dad said there might be a fire on the 9th floor! I flied out and went downstairs… My neighbors told us the fire was caused by electrical overstress.<br>
  <br>
              Next day, at night as well, we came back from my grandpa&rsquo;s home. What we saw was so terrible… Fire yesterday, flood today! The lift didn&rsquo;t work and the stairs were flooded, which could be described by one word, &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;! My neighbors told us the reason for the flood was a mistake made by the firemen last night. They didn&rsquo;t shut the fire hydrant. Finally, a resident living on the 8th floor turned it off at last.<br>
  <br>
            I really wish our life could be much safer and more beautiful.</p>
