<p>K is a graduate student from Russia. To some extent, K was forced to become an artist and I don't know the exact reason for that. However, he was kind of good at art and during that time he was interested in &quot;disappearance&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">Ⅱ</p>
<p>K arrived at Ox-Bow around four o'clock on January 7th, 2018. During the first class meeting  he was informed that he should present a work on next Friday. It's difficult for him to work out an idea in such a short period. He didn't know if he could create something for this class.</p>

<p>Bas Jan Ader is K’s favorite artist. Sometimes, he was jealous of him because he did &quot;disappearance&quot; exceptionally well like Sylvia Plath who did death exceptionally well. He was jealous of these people who could be extremely determined and he knows he could not.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, during a class improvisation section, K found a tree looked like the one from which Bas Jan fell down. He climbed up the tree, however, he didn't dare to climb to the higher branch. Finally, he jumped down from the lowest branch. What an awkward mimic!</p>

<p>One night, K went to the lake (to be accurate, according to Google Map, the river). He pulled down his pants and peed into the frozen lake. (He never told me the reason for that) He stared at the falling of his urine and imagined that he could follow that trajectory. He thought that he might be able to make a hole by keeping urinating.</p>
<p align="center">Ⅵ</p>
<p>The hot liquid definitely melted the snow on the surface. He looked into this black, small-caliber hole but still could not figure out if his urine also melted the ice underneath. But it didn't matter now. Because he was too big to fall into this hole. He was not as fluid as his urine.</p>
<p align="center">Ⅶ</p>
<p>He made a decision that he should keep peeing into that hole and try to make this hole bigger so that he could claim that that was his final project. However, when he came back to the dock on the next day that hole disappeared.</p>

<p>The unstoppable snowing added a new layer to the surface and filled up the hole. K felt a little bit sad. Not only because his project seemed to be chimerical, but also this hole's disappearance was so unexpected  and delicate.</p>
<p align="center">Ⅸ</p>
<p>However, K thought he should not give up so easily. He kept going to the lake and peeing into it. There were always footprints along the pathway to the dock. He imagined that if there was someone else could notice that hole, pee into it to maintain even enlarge it. He was waiting for his collaborator to fulfill his project.</p>
<p align="center">Ⅹ</p>
<p>Time flew. When K's professors and classmates asked what he was doing and about his final project, he lied and said he was writing a short story. He also folded a lot of envelopes for killing time and pretended to be in progress. </p>

<p>On Friday, the day for the final presentation, K didn't show up. His class left the studio and tried to find him but they didn't make it in the end. Finally, they gathered on the dock. One of them looked at the snow-covered lake and suddenly pointed towards somewhere and shouted,<br>
  <br>
Look! There is a hole!</p>
