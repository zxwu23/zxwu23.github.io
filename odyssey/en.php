  <p>Today is March 10th, 2017. I'm going to write a collection of diaries which has the start and the ending on this website.&nbsp;Today I will write today's diary, tomorrow I will write yesterday's and the day after tomorrow I will write the day before yesterday's. This project will not be finished until nearly 19 years and&nbsp;5 months later when I write about the day I was born. This is a very long and slow project. This website called &quot;tnemunom&quot; which is &quot;monument&quot;'s reverse version. I just want to use my diaries which goes back slowly to&nbsp;build a monument for myself on the Internet which envloves  quickly. I will protect and keep constructing&nbsp;it until the day it is completed! Recently, the weather is really good in Beijing due to two important conference (National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), but i'm not happy. My girlfriend went back to hometown nearly one week ago. Her grandmother thought that she is so fat (I don't think so) that she need to lose weight. She walks a&nbsp;lot to exercise and eat a little everyday. I feel sorry. Her moved into a new house, as a result there is no Wi-Fi. We can not use Facetime. Using mobiles sometimes will cause some misunderstanding. I wish the property management can handle this problem quickly. This website is my final project. I am a little bit worried about it. During the presentation I only can say several sentences and I don't know how other classmates and teachers thought about my work. But I am satisfied with this project. It is like to arrange little homework for me everyday. I&nbsp;don't know if I can persist and I wish I can. I still can not sublet my single room. My landlord still has no message for me, too. If I can not sublet it immediately, I will lose a lot of money. I&nbsp;wish I can quickly pass this kind&nbsp;of time that I&nbsp;must struggle in such a money&nbsp;issue. I wish I can get the first class scholarship this semester. I&nbsp;don't know what I am going to do tomorrow because this is the last chance to talk about &quot;tomorrow&quot; and the closest day to &quot;tomorrow&quot;, hahaha. I should imagine my future at the moment but I find that whatever I am imagining is quite vulgar. As a result, I give up imagining my future. My mother called me today&nbsp;and said that my dad has already started to prepare some delicacies for me. I&nbsp;get a little bit happy, my parents are the first investor of me. Thanks for them sincerely! I still think about my girlfriend, my little bun&nbsp;(her nickname). She has no tasty food to eat and is forced to keep diet by her grandmother, so she must be sad. I feel a little bit guilty. That's all today. Today is March 9th, 2017. I was almost late for the morning class. The morning class was taught&nbsp;by Dominic and the content was our portfolio&nbsp;and the project called &quot;design for social progress&quot; which was boring. Especially this project&nbsp;cause me trouble. My girlfriend went to the Flower and Bird Market to see fish and aquatic plants&nbsp;for her family's fish tank.&nbsp;She took a&nbsp;lot og photos and sent it to me. I was impressed by the brightness and&nbsp;tidiness. In my hometown, Shanghai, I have never seen a wonderful market like that. I also saw the bus station. Every route board has delicate decoration. Compare with some metropolises, this small city is much more delicate. In the afternoon, she went to a remedial class&nbsp;and told me about the expense. Only taking math class would cost&nbsp;18,000 RMB. I got depressed immediately. How could we get so much money! She was very sad&nbsp;as a result I must pretend not to be so disappointed to make her feel better. However I remembered that I still did not sublet our single room. Ahhhhhh! Such&nbsp;a disaster! Luckily, she went to another remedial class&nbsp;and that one asked for 11,000 which made us feel&nbsp;a little bit better and breathe a sigh of relief. It is cheerful for both of us if she could have  classes. If she cannot have classed which is like last year and just waste time in her home, both of us will be desprate and mad.At night, I eventually submit my own website on the Internet successfully, which made me really happy. It's so hard to code and make a website. In addition, my landlord told me that he could help me to sublet my single&nbsp;room. If this problem can be solved by him, it can be really helpful for my girlfriend's tuition for the remedial class. I told my girlfriend about my &quot;19 years diary plan&quot; and she seemed to think it is boring and stupid, which make me really sad and lose my confidence. But she also said that if I can really persist to write it, it would be real meaningful. She mentioned Yan Mao's words &quot; You can make meaninglessness become meaningful by push it to the ultimate.&quot; I think that I will carry on this project, I still have hopes for it. That's all today. Today is March 8th, 2017. Today is woman's day. Last year's woman's day is a memorable day. I'm preparing to set up a website for my diary project, however the host and domain&nbsp;name are expensive. Both of them will cost me nearly 600 RMB annually. To be honest, they are not so prohibitive, but&nbsp;every time I am going to use my mother's credit card to pay for something I will  hesitate. I sent a message to my mother&nbsp;and told her about that. She agreed with no hesitation but asked&nbsp;me to show her my website when it is completed.&nbsp;Her requirement made me embarrased and worried. I felt that almost all the content of my diary website could not be show to my parents. How can I solve this problem? Jose gave a funny lecture this afternoon. After this lecture, I finally succeed to submit my model of diary website onto the Internet. I hoped that my parent would not see this website at least for the moment. I would not told them this project. I chatted with my girlfriend at night. She said that 4 of her golden fish was dead and a pearlfish seemed to be seriously sick and always kept still at the bottom of the fish tank. Some fake waterweeds hurt these fishes. In addition, formaldehyde&nbsp;of the new house may cause that situation. Poor fishes. I got worried about my girlfriend's health, too. We had different idea about Beidao (a Chinese poet). I am impressed by his&nbsp;talent and thought and his poems which inspire me a lot. But she thought his poems were boring. Especially currently he launched&nbsp;a charging online class project to make money.&nbsp;I think that poet should be comment and criticized by his poetry, not by his social or daily life which just can represent his side of a normal human. But it can not be completely explained by this way. Ahhh. I got confused. Anyway, I can not hate Beidao, I love his poems&nbsp;&quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Bright Sky&quot; and his ultimate imagination and hurting metaphor. That's all today.&nbsp;Today&nbsp;is March 7th, 2017. In the morning&nbsp;I told Mary about my &quot;monument plan&quot; which was the diary website project. She questioned me about the relationship between this project and the theme &quot;system&quot;. I said something that even I did not really believe. I thought this idea definitely came from the theme &quot;system&quot; though it didn't show a very closing connection to the original theme. Mary did not question further and seemed to think about something. I finally made up my mind to do this for my final project. The man who came to and wanted to rent my single room finally didn't contact me&nbsp;though he said that whether he would rent it or not he would told me his decision. Another woman who had contacted me through the app ignored me completely when I warmly said &quot;hello&quot; to&nbsp;her and invite her to have a look at this room. I still can not sublet my room out, which really drives me crazy. My girlfriend's grandmother bought her a hula hoop to force her to lose weight. Haha, what a funny nanny! She also told me that she wanted to change her household registration&nbsp;from Jiangsu Province to Hebei Province&nbsp;and take university entrance examination&nbsp;in Hebei. If she takes the exam in Jiangsu, she must take other seven subject's resits. Jiangsu has extremely complicated rules for the examination. If she can go to Hebei Province to take exam, she will be less stressful and tuition can&nbsp;be saved a&nbsp;lot.&nbsp;I got a little hesitation. Although it seems to be very convenient and easy for her, I still get uncomfortable. Although it is easy to change back to Jiangsu, the address will not be her grandmother's&nbsp;(on her father's side) old house's address. That street has a special name which called Niu niao wang (Niu&nbsp;= cow &amp; ox, niao = pee, wang= water). She told me that long time ago the vicinity was a slaughterhouse&nbsp;and here was where to kill the cows and ox. She also told me that she spent her happiest time in a courtyard at Niu niao wang. In summer, her grandmother used to ask her to change water and feed the golden fish. When she finished her task, she would grab a peach from the peach tree and sit on the steps eating the peach. Niu niao wang doesn't exist today, here has been built some new buildings&nbsp;and has another name. However, Niu niao wang still exists on her household registration booklet, so turely. I don't want it to disappear. I have no chance to live here, but I like that name&nbsp;and I want to eat peach on the steps. That's all today.&nbsp;Today is March 6th, 2017. At midnight, I  met with night terror. It really exists! I slept on one's side and faced the wall. Suddenly I felt that something was staring at me beside my bed and I knew it clearly that it must be something that would freak me out. I wanted to turn to another side however I could not move my body although I tried my best. This situation lasted for several minutes then I fell into sleep again. I thought that&nbsp;should just be&nbsp;a nightmare which was not so terrifying. Almost people become very fragile when night draws in. In addition, last night is the first night my girlfriend went back to home, which may be the reason why I got night terror. I filled in the form for SAIC and paid the deposit for both dorm and tuition. Finally, I completed all the things related to the applicaiton for SAIC. I went back to my single room and fixed the bed board and the cabinet in the afternoon. And then that guy who contacted me yesterday came to see my room. He uses perfume. After&nbsp;visiting my room and some conversation, I felt that he would not rent this room from his tone. In addition, I&nbsp;behaved too eagerly and warmly. He asked me to give him some discount. For God's sake! I am not the landlord who owns this house and have the right to set the price. How can I give you discount? He also said something like that he had saw some room much better than this one and had the same rent.&nbsp;Blablabla. Definitely he forced me to share the rent with him. Why should I do that? I even not live here anymore! However he pretended to be a nice guy and said he did not want to make me embarassed and make things difficult for me. How could he said these high-sounding words? And he said he didn't have any experience of renting house. R u kidding&nbsp;me? Compared with me, you are so so sophisticated. At last, he told me that whether he would rent&nbsp;this room or not he would inform me&nbsp;about his final decision.C'mon! Don't be so unctuous.&nbsp;Yesterday I still dreamed that this guy must be a nice and frank man. I though too much. My girlfriend told me that she was woken up early by the noise of her neighbour's remodelling. To be honest, I am a little happy&nbsp;because by this way she will be tired at night so that she will not stay up all night any more. Last year, she always stayed up whole night and went to bed at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning which really do bad to her health. We will be kept apart&nbsp;for at least 3 months and who knows what bad things will happen during these 3 months. I am so worried. That's all today. Today is March 5th, 2017. My girlfriend went back to home. We got up together in the morning. I was afraid of hugging her. If I embrace her, I will burst into tears. She was going to leave this single room where we had lived for more than half a year. We would hardly go back to this room. I didn’t think too much when we left the room, however, I cried when we went downstair. I could not explain why I cried when I saw the stairs. We rode to the Capitaland Mall. We had our lunch at Macau Taste. I ate chicken congee and a pork chop bun. She ate wonton noodles and curry fish ball. Tasty. We would go to Macau to taste the authentic cuisine. She ordered a cup of lemon cola in Michelin. I suddenly remember that we had our first dish in The Sizzler in the Capitaland Mall last summer. Unpalatable and expensive. I also remember that the first “date” we went to the Capitaland Mall, too. I pretended to buy a pair of pants for Sweeper and actually I wanted to accompany with you. When we arrived at the railway station, I bought two rice rolls and soda for you. I cried again in the waiting room and you took a picture of the crying me. I hugged and kissed you at the barrier. After checking ticket, you made a heart using your hands and pretended to kiss me across the barrier. You left, I cried. The next time I can touch you will be at least three months later. And when will be the next time we can live together? At night I asked my landlord about the refunding the rental. Surely, that could not be so easy to deal with. He said if I could not sublet my room, I should pay for him the rent of two months, 3,200 RMB. Luckily, someone immediately contacted me and said that he would come to see the room tomorrow as soon as I put some information of this room on a rental website. I got a little happier and went to the kiosk to buy a cup of cola. Tomorrow I would fix the bed board and the cabinet and do some clean. Please rent this room! My bun arrived at her home at nearly 10:00pm. She told me that her grandmother was surprised by her weight so that she didn’t prepare dinner for her. I am so worried about her. I miss her. Tonight I will sleep alone. That’s all today.Today is March 4th, 2017. My girlfriend will go home tomorrow. At midnight, when I was sleeping, I heard that she was saying something dazedly. She said “ How about go to Guangzhou? Only you and me. We go to a fishing village. We fish and grow crops and vegetables to feed ourselves. We live here forever and never come back.” Her words sounded so so sincere. I got shocked and lost and didn’t know what could I say or if my mind was totally blank. At that moment I felt that there was a current crushing into my head. I said “ Let us go there.” Suddenly she said “ How about your family? Your dad, mom, grandpa, grandma, uncles, aunts and even maid will lose you. How can you leave them and not take care of them? A current immediately exploded in my head. My consciousness was so weak and I whispered “ Anyway, my life will not be much longer ”. Then I started to breathe deeply and made a weird sound. She was frightened by my behavior and stuffed my mouth with quilt. She apologized to me and said she would not play this kind of joke on me again. I don’t know what happened to me at that moment. Night and love make my immune system  invalid. In addition, was that really just a joke? We woke up at ten o’clock in the morning and started to clean up our room. We have so many things. We spent whole afternoon cleaning room and packing her luggage. I remember that the first time we move into this room, there was nothing except for an empty loft bed, a desk and a cabinet. However today this room filled up with our things. I wanted to cry. All these things are our life. We order carryout rice and pork rids soup. I was satisfied with the taste. She thought they were too light. We went to Xili Seafood to have our dinner. The amount of the spicy clam is quite large but all the dished didn’t taste well. We went to Dream show Mall to see the movie Logan. I bought her egg ball cakes. She was happy because she really like egg ball cakes. We went to an Internet cafe called Tale of Autumn to wait for the movie. Before she go back, we came to Tale of Autumn again. I remembered that the first time we played World of Warcraft here, I thought you were so clumsy. We had played Gluttonous Snake for a while before we went to the cinema. I have not seen the first two movie of Logan but she has. It is a touching movie and she cried at the end. After the movie, she rode bike to home and I ran after her as usual. Tomorrow she will leave. I am sad. The time I spent with her is my happiest time. That’s all today.Today is March 3rd, 2017. This morning I finally got inspiration for my final project and this idea formed instantly. I am going to write a backward collection of diaries every day. Under the ideal condition, this project will last 19 years until I finish writing the day I was born. In actuality, I always chase a sense of epic. I will use my growing body and mind to write my backward life. Using the “lowest” daily life diary to construct, record and even weave my history and my future. Based on the Internet, html files can be extended infinitely and this format will seem like a monument. I will use only words to build a monument for myself in a virtual world. Yongping Huang, Zhao Zhao and Chengrui Liu’s work. And On Kawara and Namjune Paik. My little bun will go back to home two days later. I asked her to clean up and pack her luggage. However, when I came to our room it was still extremely messy. We had our dinner in Wooden House BBQ. Delicious but every time we had meal here we will get a strange emotion like drunk although we does not drink alcohol. She said she wanted to eat egg ball cakes and drink milk tea. I said I would buy her if she could tell two words of desire in English. She said “desire” but she spelled it in a wrong way. I remind her that another one is a song’s name which I had recommended to her. She could not remember that. I told her it is Lust by The Raveonettes. When we came back to our room, however, she still ordered the carryout a cup of milk tea and egg ball cakes. My parents called me at night and asked me about the registration of SAIC. In addition, they still asked me to translate the offer and attachments in Chinese to them. We had a very long calling at least one and a half hour. My bun showed a little bit impatience. We sat on the bad and watched Korea TV series and a variety show. That’s all today. Today is March 2nd, 2017. I went to sing karaoke at midnight with my bun. Before going to sing karaoke, I lost my temper with her twice. The first time happened in our room. I saw she should pay back to the Ant Loan two hundred yuan this month and I had nearly no money in my savings card. As a result, I got out of control. When I got angry, my girlfriend will be more angry immediately and completely ignore me. After calming down, I thought that this was really not a big deal and actually she had told me about that thing last month. In addition there was some money which was paid for my taxi fee during my sickness. I apologized to her and comfort her a lot. She said because of the karaoke she would not be angry. Before we set out, she said she ran out of phone bill so I paid fifty yuan. However, shortly after her said that her Mobile Phone charges owed again! I got irritable again and criticized her for over using mobile. But when I checked her bill, I discovered that she didn’t use too much. It was just the fixed charge. She burst into rage immediately. She said “You are not happy. I am not happy. Why go to sing karaoke? Why not come back to home? ”. Every time speaking of money, I will get extremely intense especially during the beginning of a month. So many bills should be paid and suddenly I will run out of money. Then I will get anxious. To be honest, it is not a big deal at all. I lost my temper with my bun, I was so bad. Thanks for karaoke! Karaoke relieved her anger. If there was not a karaoke, I don’t know how can I make her happier again. She fell asleep on nearly 3:00am, then we took a taxi and come back to home. She was still angry in the afternoon. So I bought her fried chicken. Then we go to Xiabuxiabu to have our dinner. Firstly, she didn’t like this kind of hot pot because it seemed to be very cheap. But now she though that it is not so bad. To make her happier, we went to eat the Korea sulbing which she really obsesses with. However, we found this dessert bar is a fake one! How dare they charge the same as the genuine one? Not taste so good. When we backed to home, we sat on the bed and watched Korea TV series. I like this kind of life which is so so peaceful. That’s all today.Today is March 1st, 2017. I still have no idea about my final project. The direction was decided which is based on the feature of the Internet but I don't know how to take it into practice. My girlfriend will go home on Sunday. I let her do some cleaning and packing work. When I came back to our dorm which looked like a catastrophe, she finally finished packing up two big packet and one trunk. This trunk was too heavy to carry even for me. We called the express courier. We thought it would cost at most one hundred yuan however the courier asked 230 yuan. After sending these three big things, however, our dorm was still chaotic. We ordered two Shanxi hamburgers and a bowl of soup with pepper. Then I went to a market to buy one packet of instant noodles for myself and one bottle of white vinegar to brush a burnt kettle. We will go to sing karaoke soon at midnight because it will be half charged during midnight. My girlfriend have waited for today for a long time. In case of falling asleep during our karaoke time, I decided to sleep for a while and wake up on 11:30 pm and go to sing. That’s all today. Today is February 28th, 2017. I looked at TV Buddha and was lost in thought. I was fascinated by this king of simple but profound binary structure. Nam June Paik said, “We should emphasize on the importance of the art based on the observation of human life when we talk about art and technology. Use artistic way to think about automatic and mechanical life.” He also said, “Computer controlling technology is very important but art based on the technology is more important and this kind of art doesn’t need computer to control it. These two sentence are extremely important. Artistic  way of thinking directs to a kind of spirit. Nam June Paik believed in art and he clearly defined the dominant importance of spirit in producing art works. I am afraid of losing my belief of art. But if I don’t believe in art, what can I believe in? Perhaps it doesn’t matter what can I believe in. “Believe” itself like Kierkegaard’s belief is what really important. Mary recommended several net art artist to me. Most of them involved in politic and social activity. They are activists more than artists. I prefer Nam June Paik’s poetic technology works. My girlfriend had dinner with her friends in a Chaoshan beef hot pot restaurant. As a result I had my in school’s canteen. I ate roast duck with rice. I bought a small bowl of Baxi ice-cream for her when I came back to home. She says she wants to eat ice-cream every day. If we become rich, I will buy a ice-cream machine and make ice-cream in our house every day. That’s all today. Today is February 27th, I had my art history class which was a little bit boring this morning. I had no class this afternoon as a result I went to VIPS (a steak &amp; buffet restaurant) with my girlfriend. We have been waiting for this day for a long time! Before she going back to her hometown, she finally achieve her long-cherished dream and it is a kind of celebration of my admission of SAIC. We come on Monday noon, a week day, because during this time the steak will have the biggest discount. She ordered the steak on a piece of slate which I ordered last time. And I ordered which she last time ate. It turned out that the slate one was much more delicious. The buffet here was absolutely gorgeous as always. There is nothing taste bad. The salad bar is the best one among which I have tasted. Iced-mango is so fantastic that I can not find any word to describe the feeling. Vietnam Pho is quite tasty and the scalded prawns are so fresh. Roasted mushroom, pizza, ice-cream etc. Perfect! I get hungry again now. And it is not so expensive, two people just spend nearly 300 yuan. Definitely high cost performance. After our lunch, we went to take a bus. I said, “if I can be a professor in a university, I must be the one who treats student nicely with high academic achievement. I will offer all the resource I have to them and never let them do what I want them to do. And you can apply for my MFA.” She could not help laughing and said she will never apply for my MFA. I asked her the reason. She didn’t tell me. We were so excited and energetic due to this perfect meal and we started to imagine our beautiful future. In the late afternoon,I came back to my classroom to collect some images and materials for tomorrow presentation. Oliver was here so we started to chat. To our surprise, Mary came in and asked us about tomorrow’s presentation and our materials. Undoubtedly, we had no preparation at that time. Much worse, we have no direction totally. Then Mary said, “Why do you have nothing to show me now? Tomorrow you should be prepared well and talk with your classmates. I think you two are the two of the best students in this class and should start&nbsp; to work on this project.” Oliver and I were extremely embarrassed. At night, I bought lemon soda and ice-cream for my gf. She told me that Ziyi ranked 4th in the exam of Beijing Dance Academy. Finally, Ziyi got good luck. Then we sat on the bed watching funny Korea TV series. That’s all today.Today is February 26th, 2017. I went to visit galleries with my girlfriend. We went to Play In The Sea Fried Dumplings which my girlfriend always talking about. Tasty, indeed. The best one is the traditional pork dumpling. The wrapper was crisp and the stuffing is quite fresh and delicious and full of meat juice. The squid one was tasty, too. The roast pork one was a little bit oily. The amount of Beef Vermicelli was large. There were two exhibitions being showed in Caochangdi, Zhuyun Jiang’s “I talk to the wind” and Xiangyu He’s “HE XIANGYU”.Two exhibition were both curated well. The former was showed in a very small gallery and just exhibited four pieces. Each work occupied one room. Two pieces related to the flight MH370 in 2014 left a quite strong impression on me. Xiangyu He is quite relaxed but full of tension. I visited his solo exhibition in UCCA in 2015 but at that time I was just a ignorant little boy. This exhibition was divided into two parts. One part focused on the relationship between people and organized by playing games. Another part focused on very specific, private things which related to lemon. The whole atmosphere here is quite relaxing and confident. He showed a unique attitude to both public activity and individual life experience. My girlfriend was very weird today. She kept saying “pork” to me in a low voice. It reminded me that during summer we went to a Huis (Muslim) area in Inner Mongolia. Our friend Siting Liu told us not to say “pork” in this area. But bun started to keep whispering “perk” as soon as Siting left. In addition, she kept singing “Whatever you have money or not, come back to home and have a great Spring Festival~” in a extremely strange tone. She just said and sang these two strange things to me and didn’t say any other normal sentences. I got a little bit angry but I could nothing. When we arrived at the gate of our housing estate, she invented a new one, “Bun’s fist is a lump of flour, xiu~xiu~xiu, sliced noodles!” I freaked out. She saw I was getting crazy so she said that she would never say those again. However she could not help saying when we were buying food in a supermarket. We cooked Udon noodles as our dinner. Then we watched Korea TV series. Then we watch “I AM A SINGER” (sing show) which was so boring that I fell asleep quickly. That’s all today.Today is February 25th. Today is Sunday, my girlfriend and I got up late. We ordered the crayfish rice. Absolutely delicious. It deserves to be called “light-luxury” food. My girlfriend said there was a bookstore called “Douban Bookstore” near Peking University. Due to property company this bookstore would be closed in a few days. As a result we visit here deliberately. This is a very small bookstore which focused on selling the arts book. There were a lot of people came here before it being closed. Most of them were students from PKU and THU and some scholars from Chinese Academy of Sciences. Others were just come along for the ride (like us). My girlfriend bought the annotation of Diamond Sutra. I asked her if she wanted to apply for PKU. She said she did have this will when she was in primary school. She wanted to study history in PKU at that time. I have never thought about PKU or THU. I visited PKU’s campus with my parents in 2012. The campus was really big and beautiful. There was a lake called Weiming (nameless)  Lake. I could also see mountain behind the campus. Definitely it is a beautiful and pleasant university. Suddenly, I started to admire this kind of campus. I am going to SAIC which located in the loop of Chicago. There is no campus. I think my life there will always be in a tense and turbulent atmosphere. We took a bus to home and met with congestion. We ate hot-hot-hot in Nanhuqu West Court. Very hot and delicious always. Then my girlfriend said she was still hungry and want to eat Grandpa Stinky tofu. But both of us had no change and cash. As a result, I went to a bank near my school to draw money and told her to order first. When I came back I saw her was standing here and waiting for me. I asked her why she didn’t let granny to cook first. She said she was afraid that I would never come back to give her money and leave her forever. Then we came back home and sat on the bed watching Korea TV series. This is our new hobby and our entertaining activity before going to bed. That’s all today.Today is February 24th, 2017. In the morning, I checked my e-mail box as usual. Finally, I got the offer from SAIC. I was so happy and embraced my gf and told her I got the offer. She said, “you should tell your mom immediately!” I said maybe I should continue to sleep and tell my mom later. Actually I could not fall asleep again because I didn’t see if I achieve scholarship. I got up again and check the attachment. I got the presidential scholarship, 8000$ per year. What a big relief! I called my mom and she sounded really happy. Then I relayed my offer to my family WeChat group. All of my family member congratulate me. Today our school organized us to visit 798 Art District. Nice weather, nice mood. Most of us got the offer from our dream school. Ben will go to CCA and Oliver will go to SVA. We had our lunch in Saizeriya. I went to Yan Mao’s exhibition. When I saw this kind of wonderful paintings, I would be deeply touched by this traditional medium again. In someone’s hand, painting is still energetic and powerful. I went to IKEA with my gf at night. My mom called me again then suddenly I found that my gf disappeared. I got worry and hung up in hurry to find her. At first she didn’t answer my phone. Then she answered but didn’t tell me where she was. Finally, I found her sat on a child bed and was playing The Yin Yang Master. We had our dinner at IKEA’s restaurant. On our way home, she said she was still hungry. As a result we went to eat Grandpa Stinky tofu. When we were waiting, she suddenly told me that Ren Hang committed suicide. Her friend told her that Hang jumped from the 20th floor. Depression. We sat in a Guilin rice noodle restaurant and skimmed Hang’s Weibo. His first weibo this year is, “Every year, I have a same wish: to die earlier.” I said Hang was a man fascinated in beauty. My gf said, “Why do you have this kind of thought? He is a really serious man.” That’s all today. Today is February 23rd, 2017. This morning Dominique told me several website making softwares and platforms. I though that I could use my website instead of my physical portfolio but Dominique said I still need a physical one. I took a sweet nap this afternoon. Then I went to UNIQLO to buy me gf a pair of trousers which I promised her yesterday. Every we went to the Capitaland Mall (Tai Yang Gong Branch), we must drink the Gong Tea. We had our dinner in McDonald. I ordered one Big Mac and she ordered one Charging burger combo. She said, you should eat more. Actually I just wanted to save money and I was not so hungry. After dinner, we went to buy the trousers which cos 199 yuan. Every time my gf goes to UNIQLO to try the clothes, she will said she will never eat so much and keep on a diet. Same thing happened this time although she would forgot it immediately. On our way home, I asked her if she thought all of my works were very stupid. She said no but she told me that she thought my works are not very sincere. “Maybe you were not insincere in a normal way. Your work always become something beyond your initial imagination and after finishing you will explain it completely different. You can not persist your opinion and emotion and find a perfect form to present them.” I argued with her. I said that I didn’t want to express a clear and specific idea at all. “I just follow the feeling. Maybe it turns out totally different from my idea. I really don't think that will be a problem. Art should be art itself. Art should not contain too much artist. I stand behind art. I am not a important man. I think I am so modest.” We had a big divergent opinion about that. Then she said you must treasure your resource, time and money. “There were so many people were extremely talent but due to several limitations like money and time can not do something. But you have all of this resource. If you can not make the best use of them, you actually trample on them and yourself. I want you to consider carefully before you work.” I agreed with her. I said “Onground” was a work lacked deep thought. She said yes. In addition, she told me the reason why she didn’t stop me and tell me not do this project is that at time I was passionate on it. Then we went to 7-11 to buy a packet of chips and ice-cream. There was a strawberry in the middle of her ice-cream. She really liked it and asked me to took photo of her and her ice-cream. We backed to home and she said she wanted to paint my family members. I sent her a lot of my family photos. She picked one of my mother and my grandparents and started to painting. I sat on the bed surfing on the Internet and she sat at my side painting. Peaceful. That’s all today. Today is February 22nd, 2017. I started to think about my final project. I drew a mind map. Because I read Three Body recently, I started to be interested in cosmology and the possible social structure of the universe. Robot is another interesting point. Due to the theme “system”, computer and the internet should be considered, too. I had an idea about making several mirror balls and hang each one in front of all students’ final project during the final show. These mirror balls are like stars or planets. After calculating the angle of each ball, all the images of their projects will be present in one image. Information will be compressed and diversity will be eliminated. But actually I  only have little confidence in this idea. If I got new idea, I will give up that one. Henny gave the mass lecture about curating this afternoon. She talked about his curating experience during studying in RCA. His team had curated one exhibition based on the concept of Joseph Kosuth’s One and Three Chairs, which was interesting. I went to Indigo to eat Cold Stone. Delicious but expensive always. Then we wondered in the mall. My grandma called me suddenly and congratulate me on my offer from CCA. I said I was still waiting for SAIC’s offer. I sat on the step around the playground on the first ground with my girlfriend. I remembered that we sat at the same place in last summer holiday and you asked me if we have the karma to study in CAFA together. I cried and whispered that we had. Then we went to eat bulgogi. Delicious but expensive, too. Recently I spent so much money that I felt guilty. In the bulgogi restaurant, bun’s face turns to be  lovely red. Was the temperature here too high or just the rouge she tried in MUJI? She cupped her chin in her hands, which looked like a flower. I took a photo of her and showed her. She asked me to delete it and complained why she was so fat now. I roasted meat for my bun. I wanted to roast meat for her forever and wished that we would always have meat to eat. That's all today. Today is February 21st, 2017. This morning I received the offer from CCA. I was not so excited because I was still waiting for the offer from SAIC. I told my parents by Wechat and they looked really happy. My dad called me and told me to have a drink tonight to celebrate. My mom said she finally had a sigh of relief and today was the best day for these years. She could finally have a nice sleep. My family members congratulate me one after another today. My mom told me that she told my grandpa and he said, “Well, well, well.” My grandpa sounded really happy. I miss my grandpa. Since my grandma died in 2012, my grandpa’s house has been really dreary. He had little words to say but he always talked about my study and which university I would go. If this offer could make my grandpa happier, I would be really happy, too. It snowed in Beijing at last. This is the first snow this year. Whole street was covered by snow in just half an hour. I called my gf and waked her up to see the snow. Afternoon we had a meeting in our studio and the theme for our final project was assigned. The theme was  “system” which was very open and offered a lot of possibility. I met with Junran in the printing shop and she told me Ziyi had failed in the first test of China Central Academy Of Drama. I asked my gf and she told me Ziyi said someone who sat behind him copied his painting during the exam! This must be the reason why he failed. He was so unlucky. Godspeed him can get rid of bad luck this year. At night, my gf and I went to Food Fresh & Fruit Fancy to buy ingredients for our dinner. She wanted to eat clam but I thought that was so expensive that I refused her angrily. Then she became more angry than me immediately. As a result, I bought the clam and apologize to her. Every I get angry, she will be more angry to make me compromise. We cooked Korean hot pot by ourselves and watched Korean TV series. We have Korean night every day. That’s all today. Today is February 20th, 2017. I still have not received the offer from SAIC or CCA, which made me really anxious. As usual, Monday’s morning is boring art history class. As expect, my roommates and classmates laughed at my new hair style and said it must be my gf's master piece. At night my gf said she wanted to eat rice cakes which we ate at Green Tea Restaurant. As a result, we decided to buy some ingredients and cooked rice cakes by ourselves. Many kinds of drink in this supermarket were on sale. We bought two bottles of Yakult, two cups of rice wine and one bottle of 1.25L Coke. Then we met with the most catastrophic experience of cooking which we had never met with before. My gf put more than half package of capsicum frutescens into our wok and started to fry. Our room was burst with chilli immediately. Unfortunately, my nose got itch and without hesitation I used my hand which had cut the chilli  before to scratch my nose. Then my tears shed down and without hesitation I used my hand to wipe. I felt like magma was going to flow out of my eyes and nose. I rushed in to the restroom and left my gf cooking in the hell. I felt guilty but I could do nothing at that time. I watered a towel and used it to cover my face. And use this towel to wipe my gf’s face, too. As expected, spicy like hell. I used water to wash these rice cakes so that I can bite a little bit. I drank at least 1L Coke and 0.5L water. My gf who liked spicy food so much still hardly bear it. These drinks which we prepared for drinking for at least several days were drunk off before the half of our dinner. The moment she started to put capsicum frutescens I got a bad feeling and wanted to stop her but I failed. We nearly suffocated due to these chillies. We felt exhausted after our meal but I still had the duty to wash our wok and tableware. To be honest, it would be delicious if it was not so spicy. Then we continued to watch Korean TV series. That’s all today.  Today is February 19th, 2017. I still didn’t receive the offer. My gf said she had to cut my hair today. Finally, I could not avoid it. She still used our daily scissors instead of professional scissors for haircut. Every time she cuts my hair, I hold a washbasin awkwardly. Finishing my haircut, she asked to go to the professional barbershop to have another haircut. I looked at the mirror. I seemed to suffer from alopecia areata. If I went to the barbershop, the only thing the hairdresser here could do is having my head shaved. To be honest, I do not so care about it as a result I said that was fine. My gf said my classmates would laughed at me tomorrow. I said they daren’t do that. She laughed and asked me why. I said I was always pretty serious. We had our dinner at Macau Taste. Now this restaurant had opening celebration discount. At night, we went to Dreamshow Mall to watch “Sing”. When we saw Johnny’s dad escaped from prison to watch his son’s performance, my gf cried. Did she miss her dad? I am afraid of talking about her dad with her. I hope they can become reconciled. On our way back home, we just could find one public bike. As a result, she rode and I run after her. That’s all today.Today is February 18th, 2017. We went to Beijing Zoo today. Today’s weather was not so good. Smog was extremely heavy. Tickets here were cheap. Full ticket with the ticket of Panda Venue costed 20 yuan. But it could not be paid by mobile payment. I did’t bring cash as a result I went to the subway to draw the cash. I let my gf wait me at the entrance. When I came back, I saw her playing Yin Yang Master. Bun wanted to see panda so we go straightly to the panda avenue. Far from our imagination, pandas were dirty and lazy and lay on the ground deathly still. I guessed that they had not been bathed for a long time. They were not black and white any more. They were black and brown, especially the one who laid outdoor. But they were really comfortable. Every day they just eat, sleep and take a sunbath. Bun said she wanted to become a panda. Then we saw golden monkey pooping. Poop was stuck on his whole tail. Why he didn’t clean himself? Can female monkeys fall in love with a monkey with a poop-covered tail? Nocturnal Animal Venue was really dark. All the animals here live in narrow cages, which was extremely depressed. We saw a cotton candy seller. Bun told me to buy one for myself. She knew I was obsessed with cotton candy. There was only one tiger wandering lazily in the Lion & Tiger Mountain. Where elephants lived looked like a jail. Will these animals live in the zoo until they die? Do they have the chance to go back to nature? I stood behind a penguin sculpture pretending to be a penguin. Bun took a picture of me . My clothes’ color was completely same as the sculpture. Finally, we still had not went to Beijing Aquarium. Time was limited and tickets were too expensive. We planned to visit aquarium in the future. Then we went to Reptile & Amphibian Venue to see frogs, lizards and tortoises. We went to Aegean Mall to have our dinner at TubeStation Pizza. TubeStation never lets us disappointed. Delicious and inexpensive. Then we wandered in Aegean Mall and went to a froyo shop where you should weigh yogurt by yourself. I could not control the amount and took too much. Totally 75 yuan but tasty. On our way home, I figured out a passenger was my gf’s new friend on the bus. She left me and sat on the last row by herself to avoid him. When we got off the bus I asked her the reason. She said she had not replied his message for a long time. Today is a happy day. I wish I can always be so happy with my gf. But I still don’t receive the offer from SAIC. That’s all today.Today is February 17th, 2017. No offer today. The presentation of the first week’s work was on today. During the presentation, our group wearing weird costume pumped the ballon. With out light in the room, I nearly could not find the hole on the box, which made me really anxious. I think this project is extremely boring. It is just an entertainment in the amusement park but I still need to explain this project in a professional tone. It should be related to the theme “Ritual”. As a result, we must make this piece look meaningful and profound. Like the tense of interpersonal relationship or the relationship between perpetrator and victim. Sucks! But we still need to finish the assignment. I believe that the interpretation of art should radiate naturally. Artist’s interpretation of his own work is always suspicious. I would never ever do this kind of suck thing again. All the works this week only had the form but lacked soul. Maybe I am too mean because this is just a “Performance art” experience class which make students know some about performance art. I am still not get rid of viral flu completely. I still have a runny nose. I went to supermarket to buy ingredient for our dinner with Bun at night.For our hot pot, we bought tenderloin meat, mushrooms and rice cakes, etc. Bun said considering I was still suffering from sickness she will not put chilli pepper in our hot pot. Tonight’s hot pot was extremely delicious! But we bought too much ingredients so we planned to eat leftovers tomorrow. I got tired as a result I fall asleep during watching video. Bun started to take photo of me and play my head. I would be very sensible during sleep. As a result I got nearly crazy. She put Finn beside my head. When I saw this photo, I felt so warm and happy immediately and fall asleep again peacefully. That’s all today. Today is February 16th, 2017. No offer. Bun is going to back to home. I asked her when she prepared to go. She told me her grandma’s house was just finished decoration several days ago. The house was smelly due to formaldehyde. In addition, there was no Wi-Fi and air conditioner here. As a result, she didn’t want to go home immediately. I don’t want her go home so early. I want to accompany with her more. This must be the last time I spend with my Bun in this city, Beijing. Next year she will come back there but I will have no chance to accompany with her and stay with her. I must try my best to make her happy. Eating delicacy, visiting aquarium and doing massage to her. Today is the first day of the art history class. The teacher is a Canadian with sideburns who looks like a Greek sage. We went to eat udon noodles for our dinner. Then we bought some biscuits and chips. When we came back home, we sat on the bed and watch Kangxi. At first, I even didn’t want to see because I thought variety shows must be stupid. However I could not stop watching later. So funny! Several years ago, I thought Kangxi was a historical TV show. Actually, Kangxi doesn’t represent the emperor of the Qing Dynasty. Kangxi represents Kangyong Can and Xidi Xu. That’s all today.Today is February 15th, 2017. A suffering but finally relieving day. Beijing Film Academy would publish the result of the first test. Bun took her physical examination in her hometown and would come back to Beijing at night to take the first test of Communication University of China. I started to be extremely anxious. I worried about whether she will suffer a nervous breakdown if she failed in the first test.  I had checked BFA’s official website several time before ten o’clock but there was still no result published. I sent message to my gf and felt that she was in a bad mood, too. I went to the toilet and checked it again around ten o’clock. Failed. I lost my mind in the toilet. I didn't know if I should inform her immediately but I know she must ask me in several minutes. I called her finally and she accepted calmly and told me to bring her painting supplies to the train station and meet with her to take another examination. I told our group members and left during the afternoon class. I saw her at the exit. I embraced her. At the moment, I felt like that everything finally was ended. Maybe both of us hold no hope on this examination at all. We just didn’t want this year to finish so quickly after missing the associating examination and lost any chance to take the exam of any art school. We found a goal for us not to give up, which tortured us a lot. I said we should not go to CUC to take the exam and we should go to have our dinner. She said yes. On our way home, we sat on Line 14. This year was finally over in such a ridiculous way. I remembered the last time we sat on this subway was after her missing her associating examination due to some mistakes of the registration. She sat next to me as same as today and we talked about the possibility to take a exam of BFA which didn’t need certification of the associating examination. We regarded it as a chance but if we know that was just on one’s last legs with no result at the very beginning? It was over. This kind of torturing finally finished from December 4th, 2016. I even heaved a sigh of relief. I don’t know what will happen next year. I love my bun. I don’t want her to still undergo this kind of suffering. But what can I do? I have no better solution at all. We went to Xiabuxiabu hot pot. Then we came back home and sat on the bed watching Tales of the Unusual. At that moment, we become purely happy together, just like in March, 2016. That’s all today. Today is February 14th, 2017. After drip-feeding yesterday, I felt a little bit better today. Bun went back to her hometown this afternoon. She left a little bit late but fortunately she caught the railway. Then I want to school. Today is the first class day after winter holiday. I missed the lecture given in the morning. This week’s project is a group project and will last only one week for us to warm up. The theme is “ritual” based on contemporary art. Then each group received an item to inspire us. Our group got an air pump. I had no interest in this theme and still suffered from illness. In addition, I was worried about my gf’s physical examination. As a result, I don’t want to waste my energy and time on this project. We had a casual discussion and decided to make a box which was filled with  balloons. We will invite teachers or classmates to put their head in the box then we will pump air in to the balloons in the box. Boring. I ate Lanzhou noodles at night. Bun went to her new house and lived with her grandma. She said property company still had not finished some issues and the air conditioner was not installed, too. No WIFI, no hot water and no gas. She said she was so cold. Tomorrow Beijing Film Academy will publish the result of the first test. Godspeed my bun. I still don’t feel well now, so that’s all today. Today is February 13th, 2017. Seriously sick. Recently I get nearly crazy and startled wake up to check my e-mail every night nearly 1 am. Due to the high fever, I have been out of my mind for several days. Last night I woke up with a start several continuously. I still suffered from high fever despite drip-feeding yesterday. I was in muddle and bun kept wipe my head using cold wet towel. She had stayed up for whole night to prepare for the test of Beijing Film Academy and took care of me. I told her to have a nap. I was worried about her health, too. She went to BFA to take the test and I fall asleep during the day. Then she came back ahead of time. I asked her why she came back so early. She said she did well in the test and she was worried about me. I had another drip-feeding tonight. I wish that I can get better tomorrow. Bun would back to her hometown to take physical examination tomorrow. The day after tomorrow we will get the result of BFA. I had a little bit worry about that. I am so afraid. My bun. I love you. Wish my love can defeat everything. That’s all today. Today is February 12th, 2017. Seriously sick. Continuously high fever. Viral influenza. Bun accompanied me to have drip-feeding at night. No offer. I am too weak to write today. Today is February 11th, 2017. Today is The Lantern Festival. Nice weather. Bun had her first test of BFA today. She told me a story on our way to BFA. There was an old master who masters the art of Tangyuan making in her hometown. He was her father’s good friend as a result he would give my bun’s family a lot he made. This master’s family was a “Tangyuan family”. The art of Tangyuan making handed down from his great grandfather. The secret was that there was a old Tangyuan made by his great grandfather which was buried beneath the ground of his home. Every year when he started to make Tangyuan, he would dug it out and take a little part of the old one and put it into the new year’s paste. As a result his Tangyuan could be absolutely delicious and keep the traditional taste. There were so many beautiful girls and handsome boys in BFA. I said this is another art exam group which was totally different from ours. When she took the test, I rode a bike and wondered around. I rode to Beijing Normal University because it was where Xiao, one of the most important teacher even person in my life, studied and played music. I imagined the picture of a plain-clothed Punk guy lived in this campus. Then I got tired and I went to a Mcdonald’s. I bought an ice-cream and started to read Three Body. Suddenly a little child bursted into tear and cried madly. Extremely loud and bothering. His mother even could not stop him. Mcdonald’s manager came and gave cake and ice-cream to him but it didn’t work, too. Every one stared at them. Until his father came, this child kept yelling. I got a little bit dizzy during that time. Then bun finished her test and I came back to meet with her. On our way home, I felt weak all over on the bus. I lay on the bed as soon as we got home. Bun went to buy some Tangyuan with black sesame and cooked for us. I sat on the upper berth and she sat on the bottom berth. We watched a variety show together. Around 12:00 am, Oliver sent a message to me and told me he got the offer from SVA. I congratulate him and started to be anxious. Where is my offer? I become dizzier and dizzier. Tomorrow morning I should went to school to register for the next semester. That’s all today. Today is February 10th, 2017. Bun is going to take her first entrance exam of Beijing Film Academy. We said we should do some review today, but actually we didn’t do much and most of time we watched Tales of the Unusual. There were so many things to remember which all belong to new and unfamiliar field for us. We cannot even distinguish which is important or which is out of date. This is not something like painting, drawing art we studied before. Though we watched some art movie, there were lots of things we had never heard before. Without systemic review, we cannot catch the key to the exam. In addition, actually Bun didn’t pay enough attention to this exam. She took many high-quality photos for her portfolio, but her portfolio would not be showed to the interviewer in the third exam if she cannot pass the first exam. Sigh. Should I force her or ask her seriously? I don’t know. I don’t think I dare to be angry with her. I wish my Bun’s situation could become better but I don’t think I can solve the problem. She should depend on herself to escape from the mash. I really don’t know whether I am helping her or harming her. At night, I bought fried chickens and a pomelo. We sat on the bed eating and watching Japanese television series. We should go to bed early today for the exam tomorrow. That’s all today. Today is February 9th, 2017. We planned to go to SDX Joint Bookstore to read some references for reviewing. We ate dumplings as our lunch and got a little bit sleepy after our lunch. We always get sleepy due to eating too much. We took the subway to the bookshop. We nearly fell asleep on the subway and we became more and more sleepy. Bun said she was so tired that she wanted to take a seat. As a result, I went to the shelf to pick some books for her. Sigh. Most of this kind of books were extremely complicated and too obscure to understand in several months. I chose a book which looked like relatively fundamental. Then I found Bun was sitting under a traveling book shelf and reading a book about traveling and eating in Taiwan. The book which I chose was really thick published by New York Institute Of Photography. As expected, she fell asleep completely in several minutes. We walked out of the bookstore. Today’s weather was really nice. The night was really clean and clear. The wind was cool. We regained our consciousness immediately. Bun said , “Sorry, I should read the book to prepare for the exam but I was too sleepy.” I looked at her and looked at the sky. I didn’t feel anxious but peaceful. She took a picture of the sky and I put her hand in my hand. We watched Tales of the Unusual at night and said we should do review whole day tomorrow. That’s all today. Today is February 8th, 2017. I came back to Beijing. My mom cooked duck noodle soup for me. As usual she cooked so much that I was stuffed. She asked me whether i received the offer. I said I was not anxious about it at all but actually I worried a lot. I listened to Wang Fei’s Degeneracy on the express all the way. Finally I met with bun again. I embraced her for a long time. I didn’t so miss her when we were apart from each other but now I miss her so much. I imagine that the next time i left her we will be apart from each other for at least three months. When I go abroad, whether we have the chance to be with each other? Weird. I missed her most when I was closest to her. She gave me the gift she prepared for me which was an empty ablum. There was a sentence on the last page, "to the most gentle boy for me, Qiuchen". I cried. She asked me whether I would bring it to America. I said yes and I will put our photos into it and always bring it with me. She showed me the photos her took yesterday. There were several of them which were really potential. Bun’s friend was too photogenic. If we can do some typesetting we definitely can produce a high-quality book of her photography. Sigh. I wish bun can be well sponsored. Her photos are really better than some stupid boring film photos which regard themselves as cool. We ate fruits prepared by my mom and some snacks I brought. We had many divergences when we picked the pictures which were good enough to put in portfolio. These photos must be good enough for the interview but I was worried about whether bun could pass the first two exams before the interview. It is the time for the first exam of Beijing Film Academy in three days. We planned to go to bookstore to read some reference books to review some fundamental points tomorrow. Today is February 7th, 2017. I will go back to Beijing tomorrow. I brought the new luggage to my grandpa’s home and say goodbye to him in person this morning. In the afternoon I went to MUJI to buy a lamp as a new year’s gift for Bun. Then I went to Jiuguang Market to buy some snacks. At night I packed up my luggage. Bun took photos of her best friend today. She told me she did some really good works. She asked me to bring my polaroid so that the gift she bought me can be used. When I found my polaroid out I found the batteries had already be moldy. I went to the living room to find some batteries in the TV set, which made some noise. As soon as I tested the batteries in my room, my dad came in suddenly and asked me why did I spend so much money recently. Then he showed me my bills. I thought I was in trouble. He said why do you have some payments in Beijing however now you were in Shanghai? Did you let others to use your credit card? I lied to him. I said these companies registered in Beijing as a result they showed Beijing XX companies. Fortunately, my dad did not question me more closely but I thought my dad was not stupid. He must have already known something. When I read pornographic novels when I in middle school, he discovered it through some small clues and told me not to read to much tactfully. I told Bun this thing and we should not spend too much money. She said she got it and we could just cook noodles by ourselves at home. I know it is impossible. If we just eat noodles at home, Bun would be angry and disappointed immediately. I don’t want to make her sad. I want to earn money. Spending my parent’s money like this way is extremely bad. I feel guilty and sorry. Sigh. My classmates earn money through painting some business illustrations and do some business design. I am anxious. If I should go to learn some business design skills? Sigh. That’s all today. Today is February 6th, 2017. I went to my uncle’s home to play PS4. Today both my uncle and aunt were at home. I played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which was definitely entertaining. Due to the Spring Festival discount, I bought GTA5 & PS Plus. I thought GTA5 would be downloaded and installed well before afternoon but it wouldn’t. The day after tomorrow I will go back to Beijing so I will have no chance to play it till May. My uncle said it was my gift and I could bring it to America but I still need to wait for at least half a year. The pear juice pressed by their Hurom juicer is absolutely fantastic. I will buy one when I earn enough money to improve my life quality. In the afternoon, Bun let me to decide what she was going to eat for lunch. She said if I could not choose the right one it turned out I didn’t care about her. Unfortunately, I ordered a wrong one. I withdraw my order immediately and then checked her bills to find what she had eaten recently. I order a beef hamburger for her. Unfortunately again, she said she wanted the chicken one. Then I called Burger King to change my order. Bun was in good mood today as a result she didn’t blame me. But I started to worried whether I really didn’t know and care about her. Sigh. Bun sent me a cute emoji which looked like a marine creature. She asked me what it actually was. I said I didn’t know well. Maybe it was a sea lion. She said the reason why we could not figure it out was that we didn't visit an aquarium. If we visit an aquarium we will acquire the knowledge of marine creatures. Bun wants to go to an aquarium. We should go to an aquarium when I came back to Beijing. That’s all today. Today is February 5th, 2017. Today I went to Shanghai Biennale with my mother. I visited OCAT to see what is contemporary art with my dad yesterady so it is the time to take my mother to see what her son is doing now. My mother showed a great passion which was really beyond my imagination. She took a lot of photos and sometimes said some work was like my domain. My mother is lovely sometimes. Today is my father’s birthday. Lately some relatives told us we should not celebrate my father’s 60 year old birthday because this year was his birth year. If we celebrate it, we will make Tai Sui angry. As a result we went to a restaurant to have two little cakes to “celebrate”. It was ridiculous that my father could not eat a cake but we could. I also ate a steak cup and my mother ate some ice-cream. My mother told me that at first she still want to buy my dad a cake this morning. My dad refused angrily and my mother insisted on that. Suddenly my dad lost his temper and went out of home to go to work. I thought that just be his morning mood. To be honest, however, celebration is not so important from my perspective. It’s two years since I’ve been back for Chinese New Year and celebrated my dad’s birthday. This year I came back home and stayed with my family, which I thought was wonderful enough. Bun ordered a pizza tonight secretly. I discovered it and she told me that was a way to celebrate my father’s birthday in the distance. That’s all today. Today is February 4th, 2017. I went to OCAT to visit a group exhibition called “Dragon Liver Phoenix Brain” with my father. The concept of the curation is quiet interesting. The curator emphasized on the gender and arranged the space according to artist’s gender. Which impressed me a lot is the room of Xiangqian Hu’s “The Secret Task” and Ji Yu’s “Witch’s Stone”. Two videos were shown on two opposite walls. During watching, I had to switch my had to watch but I could not saw them at the same time. The relationship between these two pieces was very close but showed an antagonist trend at the same time. Ke Ling used computer software to make art. The concept was interesting but his works were still displayed by videos. I thought they still did not catch the core of the computer. The relationship between the story and the closed curve on the screen of Xin Sheng’s work confused me. Pingyuan Lu’s installation and story were very clever. From curation to exhibits, I thought this exhibition was a success. I discovered several brilliant Chinese young artists and it seemed to be the first time I clearly felt the power of curation. My dad, however, asked me a question after leaving the gallery. “Is this contemporary art ? Seriously?” He showed me a great sense of being cheated and he said even my works were interesting than these artists’. He especially pointed out “The Secret Task” was totally boring. Is performance art just about a man standing in the river, catching the fish, drilling wood to make fire and then taking a video? I didn’t know how to answer his question directly. To be honest I could not clarify academically the concepts of theses works, too. But I didn’t resist these like my father. I tried to told  him to read these works required exercise because contemporary art was far from our retina. Appreciating contemporary art needed imagination and thinking. But I was still scared of something. Is no resistance a good thing? It seems that contemporary art is fed and protected in a small circle, which confuses me a lot but I don't know how to say. I told my dad he could read some book related to this domain in his leisure time. If he could not just resit them blindly, he could find a lot of fun in contemporary art. Then we went to a McDonald to have some chips and coffee. I went to walk with my parents at night. We talked about today’s exhibition and I said I should bring my mother to see what is contemporary art which her son was doing now, too. That’s all today. Today is February 3rd, 2017. I went to uncle’s home to play PS4 and PSVR. PSVR had so many different wires need to be connected, as a result it was a little bit tricky to install. The effect, however, was definitely amazing. If you don’t experience it by yourself, you cannot clarify this feeling at all. Several demos were not so out-standing but a VR film was extremely impressive. Some details and secret views could be reached by viewer’s movement. This kind of interaction, from my perspective, is extremely natural and effective. Compared with constructing a complete scene, I thought which had stories and scripts would be a very potential area to explore. My uncle treated me cordially and cooked fried chicken wings by AirFryer for me. Although he could not control the time well so many wings were burnt, they were still delicious. He fall asleep when I was playing “Battlezone”. Before I left, he told me that I can bring the PS4 and PSVR to America. “ Staying alone in other country must be lonely. If you feel lonely, you can play games to relieve.” I was moved. He also let me bring a bottle of yellow rice wine to my dad. During the dinner tonight my dad was drunk, yelled at me and said I had no talent for art. I missed Bun. It seemed like that she suffered mood swings today. She told me she could not help being lazy. I comforted her. That’s all today. Today is February 2nd, 2017. I went for a long walk with my parents today. We walked for at least 13km. I was totally exhausted but my parents seemed to still be energetic. My mom asked me about the school thing. So far I have had no meaningful message from SAIC or CCA. The only thing I receive is some advertisement messages and reminder of lack of information which were sent automatically. My dad told me not to be so worried, but I could not help worrying about that until I really get the offer. We went to a lot of places today. We saw the new location of JAZZ BAR. We went to Zhang Yuan to take photo. We went to Wu Jiang Snack Street but could not decide to go to which restaurant. We saw a coooool motorcycle. My father tried to find toilet in a hotel but he failed finally. Then we went to eat cups of cream in Kaisiling. We had our lunch at Westgate Mall. I ate curry and my parents ate wonton and small steamed stuffed bun. We spent a lot of time finding a small monument constructed by my mom’s office. It was so hard to find due to it’s mini size and nondescript color. 71 Line was so strange. We talked a lot today. I was still a little child. Walking on the road to the Tesco before, i remembered that long time ago every Friday i expects to go to Tesco. On our way home, I sat on the bicycle and my dad push the bicycle. The basket was filled with food and daily necessities. Tomorrow could be a lazy day. I cannot remember the last time we went to Tesco and now there is no Tesco any more. Bun asked me why I loved her although she was a bad girl. I don’t know. I told her not to talk nonsense. That’s all today.Today is February 1st, 2017. The Spring Festival will be ended in two days. I came back to our home from my grandpa’s home with my mom. I went to Xintiandi to watch movie tonight with my parents. Before the film, we had our dinner at AKASAKATEI. I remembered that I used to eat here with Yuantai Cai and brother B. Every time we came to here, we would spent several hours eating. The film we watched is Arrival. I think it is relatively nice but my mom fall asleep during the film and said it was boring. It is the first time I was shocked  by linguistics which definitely is an interesting and meaningful domain. We missed the last bus so we had to walk home. On our way home I talked the story with my dad. At the beginning, I thought my dad was confused but it turned out that he was more clear than me. After getting home, I help bun to register on the exam of Communication University of China. That’s all today. Today is January 31st, 2017. I went to my uncle’s home and visit him and my aunt. He said to me, “look at your gift!” as soon as I opened the door. I got some bad feeling immediately when I saw the big box on the ground. It was a PSVR! For god sake, I just casually chat with him about PSVR the day before yesterday. I just said it was a interesting things but I really didn't imply I wanted one! More terribly, I thought my uncle as a layman of the video games would not buy PS4 for running PSVR. I was right. He didn’t buy a PS4. I was extremely embarrassed at that time and the atmosphere in the room became weird, too. My grandparents came to see what happened, too. My uncle became unhappy as seeing my awkward face. I told him if I want to run the PSVR, we needed a PS4. He said, “Okay, buy one now!” I was extremely shocked. For god sake! I dind’t know how to say. I had never looked forward my uncle to buying something to me. I had no comment on that if he bought himself something. But it was obvious that he bought me the PSVR. My dad said he paid for the PS4. Damn it! He would cut my living expenses of the next month. Sigh. A fantastic new PS4 was in front of me but I could not be happy. To not to disappoint my uncle as well as relieve the atmosphere, I had no choice to see the PS4 on Taobao. He came and told me to but the PS4 PRO otherwise the slim one would be too low. I had hesitated for a while and finally made the decision to add it to the shopping cart. Four thousand yuan for the PSVR plusing four thousand yuan for the PS4 PRO, my uncle paid the bill with no hesitation using his credit card. The atmosphere became relaxing finally. I told him I would come here several days later to play the PS4. My uncle said he would warmly welcome. He became really happy and pleased and I felt much better, too. He retired one years ago. He must be bored at home alone. I would be gratified if I could make him happy. He also let us taste the juice made by his expensive  Hurom. It tasted really fantastic. Bun said it was the benefit of living not raising a child. Spare money, enough freedom and less pressure. I thought one couldn't  make an omelet without breaking eggs. Today my uncle became the chef and liberate my aunt. He told us not to sitting on the table and today’s lunch was a new style lunch. But my grandpa didn't like it. He thought lunch could not be in this style. It is a farce that every doesn’t sit well. My uncle’s “invention” was wasted and we finally sat around the table. But the dished were extremely gorgeous. Every dish was the first-class standard, which persuade my grandpa immediately. I backed to my grandpa’s home (on my mother’s side). My mom asked me if I enjoyed myself today. I didn’t dare to tell her that he bought me two video game players which costed nearly 10,000 yuan. That’s all today. Today is January 30th, 2017. Today is a boring day. Still no offer. Painting boring landscape. Watching TV. Go shopping with my mother. I cooked steamed potatoes, mushroom and bacon tonight for myself. It was a little bit too oily but higher calorie, better taste. I helped bun to do some research on the school. I wish she could pay more attention to the first test. I am worried about her. She seems to be careless. That’s all today. Today is January 29th, 2017. My father asked me to accompany with my grandparents (dad’s side) to visit the  Bund in the afternoon. At the beginning, I didn’t want to go out at all. Today’s air pollution seemed to be serious. Smog was heavy. Why did my dad say that we could not waste such a good weather? What’s wrong with his eyes? Especially in the afternoon, I am always sleepy. It’s good time for taking a nap. In addition, some relatives would come to visit my grandpa (mom’s side). As a result, I refused to go out toughly. However, my dad was much tougher than me. For God’s sake! He let me find out my grandpa’s wheelchair and pump up its tiles. I couldn’t find the air pump at first. After finding out it, I could not pump the tiles up. At the same time, my dad called me and asked me why I still didn’t get ready well, which made me extremely flustered. Fortunately, my uncle who coming to visit my grandpa helped me to pump up the tiles successfully. My dad blamed me harshly as soon as I went downstairs, which made me extremely angry. It was very very hot this afternoon, my face streamed with sweat as soon as I got on the taxi. Then we went to the North Bund. Because we only have one wheelchair, my grandpa and grandma had to take turns to sit on it. My father also called my uncle to accompany with my grandparents. My grandpa said he felt tired but my dad suggested we could keep walking a little bit more. To be honest, we kept walking a lot not “just a little bit”. My uncle brought his Mobile PTZ to show off. Then it started to be windy and the smog was blew away. But it became cold immediately. In addition, my grandpa felt tired and wanted to go home. At first we want to take a seat and have some food firstly but I could not find even one opening restaurant. As a result we started to go to the main road. After walking a long distance, they took a taxi and I brought the wheelchair to get a bus to go back to me grandpa’s home. Although at the beginning I didn’t feel happy, now I think today’s experience should be my precious. Two 90-year-old grandparents could be energetic enough to go out with their descendants, which must be our good luck. That’s all today. Today is January 28th, 2017. HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR! The first day of the year of the rooster I ate spring rolls this morning. My dad invited me to watch Duckweed directed by Han Han. To be honest, it was not so bad as many people said. My dad made a high comment on it and said this was what a new year’s performance slot should be. I asked why we didn’t go to watch Arrival which I thought might be much better. He told me Han Han’s weibo said you could take participant in the drawing for a Subaru car if you purchase the film ticket. After film, I went home first to take a box of citrus and then I came back to my grandpa’s home. My mom forced me to paint again. I felt really free and relaxed every time living in my grandpa’s home. Bun’s new year was not pleasant. She neither ate anything spicy nor watched a interesting movie. I should make up for her after backing to Beijing. That’s all today. Today is January 27th, 2017, Lunar New Year's Eve! It is 2 years since the last time I celebrated the Spring Festival at home. Finally, I came back home and celebrated the Spring Festival comfortably. As usual, my parents and I celebrates Lunar New Year’s Eve at my grandpa’s home. My uncle and aunt go to my grandpa and grandma’s (dad’s side) home to accompany with them. We had a absolutely fabulous family reunion dinner. Chicken soup, roasted duck, salad, fried mushrooms, steamed fish, etc. But I didn’t know what’s wrong with my dad. He fried mushrooms without slicing them into pieces first. The middle parts of mushrooms were not tasty. He drunk a bottle of yellow wine and became drunk. He asked me to buy him another bottle of yellow wine. To my surprise, the small shop didn’t close at Lunar New Year’s Eve! Why did they not have family reunion dinner? Or would they eat after closing the shop? My dad said when he was a child his family would cook eight fried dishes and eight cold dishes during Lunar New Year’s Eve. He mentioned peanuts, boiled chicken, preserved eggs, jellyfish. After dinner my dad fall asleep on the sofa but he should go home to take care of my grandparents because my uncle and aunt would go home later. My mom asked me to see him to home. But to be honest, I couldn't tell why I didn't want to leave my grandpa’s home during Lunar New Year’s Eve. As a result I saw my dad to the subway station and left him. He seemed to be clear when we arrived at the subway station but I still worried about him. I told him not to fall asleep in case miss getting off the subway. I also told him to take picture and sent them to tell me and my mother where was him in time. Then I came back my grandpa’s home. My dad came back home safely, too. Spring Festival Gala sucks. Today I hardly sent “best wish” messages to my classmates and friends. Bun celebrates today with her new friends! Last several years she was always alone. She eventually could have a nice warm celebration dinner! But when will the next time we celebrate new year together? I checked my email around midnight and there was no offer. I had wished that I could receive a special gift this night and it turned out that I think too much. New Year is coming! Best wish! That’s all today. Today is January 26th, 2017. I start to live in my grandpa’s home today. Bun had stomach ache during last midnight and sent message to me. But I was so sleepy at that time so that I ignored her. As a result, I got my punishment today. She treated me like I treated her last midnight. Sigh. I called her a lot of times and sent her messages but she just relied me “the unhappy sets”: “NO”, “Nothing” and “Never mind”. She said if I could ignore her when she wanted to talk to me, she could ignore me, too. Every time she treats me like that drives me crazy. I always think I could just wait until she calms down. I will be, however, extremely anxious every several minutes and I could not tell the reason. She finally forgave me at night. I felt like it turned to be sunny at the moment. She would go to Yanjiao to celebrate Lunar New Year’s Eve with her friends. Although I could not accompany with her, at least her friends could be with her to make tomorrow night warm. I watched “Vive L’Amour” directed by Mingliang Cai. Amazing. Six-minute crying footage is so bold and fantastic. Quoting Cuican’s (Douban user) comment on this film: When she crossed the park with the clear voice of her heels, sat on the chair in the morning and started to cry. The voice of crying changed from helplessness to intensity, from intensity to composure. You could understand that everything is in this movie except for love. That’s all today. Today is January 25th, 2017. I went to buy some New Year cards for my mom. I went to both a stationery shop and a post office but neither of them offered. I even spent more than 30 minutes queuing in the post office! I finally bought them in a kiosk near Shanghai Library. Bun took photo of her friends today. At night, my family went to Shenyuexuan to have our family reunion dinner. It is several years since the last time all the family member gathered together. Last two years I stayed in Beijing and my mom should go to take care of my grandpa (mom’s side). This year I came back home. In addition my grandpa’s nanny still stayed at home until tomorrow as a result my mom can come here. Most of the dishes were delicious except for the Lobster with Noodles. It was too small but still expensive. Bun had dinner with her friends, which made me feel better because I don’t want her to be hungry when I am eating and drinking. Although I didn’t do anything today, I am very tired. Maybe the reason why I am exhausted is lack of an afternoon nap. That’s all today. Today is January 24th, 2017. I interviewed my grandpa afternoon. What is new this time was that he talked about his father’s and mother’s life. He told me his mother (my great-grandma) was born in a literate family whose family name was “Tu”. Most young generation of this family went to big cities and took higher education. Her name is “Jingruo Tu” which is a very beautiful and elegant name. I could not help thinking people living that time were extremely good at naming their next generation. My great-grandpa, Zemin Wu, moved to live with my great-grandma after marriage. My great-grandma was a literate woman although she hadn’t stayed at school. She had no job but taught her children to read and write at home. My great-grandpa’s income was limited as a result they depended on the rent from their farmland. Until today I didn’t know that the year my grandpa joined the Communist Party was 1945 at that time he was just a twenty-year-old young man. As a result he did not actually take part in the War of Resistance. I once thought joining the Party was something needed extremely high initiative but now I start to wonder about that according to my grandpa’s words. I don’t how to say. We stopped after talking about his first meeting with my grandma in Shanghai. My grandpa likes talking about history very much so today he was very happy and these stories actually were interesting and meaningful. Bun went to Indigo Mall to buy a pair of glasses which costed 500 yuan. She told she would use her savings to pay for the bill monthly by herself. At first I was a little bit unhappy but as soon as I saw her happy face I got rid of worrying immediately. A pair of high-quality glasses is necessary and worth. That’s all today. Today is January 23rd, 2017. I watched Reply 1988 whole day. As it turns out that Korea series could be so interesting. My grandma asked me what I was watching now during the lunch and I felt a little bit embarrassed to tell her. My mom asked me to share my resource with her. Bun asked when would I come back to Beijing again. Sigh. Undoubtedly, I want to go to accompany with her. I don’t know, however, how to tell my parents that i wanted to come back to Beijing so early. I have no valid reason at all. In addition, it’s really rare chance to reunion with my family before going abroad. I will have no chance to celebrate the Spring Festival with my family when I go to America. I told her I maybe come back on 8th Feb and she complained why I could not come back on 7th or 6th or 5th. Sigh. I told Bun to use my credit card to go shopping instead use my debit card. She went to a newly opened mall called Dream Show. She bought some items for her photo project on the day after tomorrow. My grandpa gave me a book called Contemplate the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. That’s all today. Today is January 22nd, 2017. I visited James Turrell’s exhibition at the Long Museum this morning. The ticket costed 200 yuan, which was quite expensive. During being in the queue buying the tickets, a guy got shocked when he heard of the price. But he still bought the ticket because it would be so embarrassed if he left after hearing of the price. Haha. This exhibition emphasized sensation. Making illusion in peace and blurring the boundary between the illusion and the truth in space could not be described clearly in words. Compared with these installation showed in this exhibition, I preferred “Roden Crater” more. I was extremely shocked and impressed as soon as seeing some pictures and blueprints of this project. Ambitious and poetic. This project makes me feel about a chance which can open a  kind of secret passage through our sensation. If I can get the opportunity, I will visit it definitely. I rode bike to RAM in the afternoon to visit Dong Song’s retrospective exhibition. A series works of wave and water were ingenious. “Touching Father” was extremely touching and clever. “No word monument” was interesting, too. Song is a wise man with the oriental knack. Wonderful artist. Before leaving, I took some wafer biscuits from “Eating The City”. The curation was good, too. Lots of things to learn today. Bun told me that her friend advertise her photos and then a lot of people come to invite her to take photo of them. At first I was happy about that but I started to worry about whether there would be some strange bad guys who would do harm to Bun. Bun said she would not to take photo of strangers but her friends, which eased me a lot. Bun said she wanted to do some paintings at night. To be honest, I think that it must be her sudden impulse and she would not keep painting. It would be wasted if she went to buy painting supplies. Then I remembered that I had some oil painting supplies in my dorm and my roommate, Fushuai Li, was still staying there. I sent message to him to ask him to do me a favor and called Bun to get my painting supplies from Li. I felt exhausted today due to two exhibitions and  a long distance riding. Bun went to have BBQ with her friends at night. I told her not to eat to much otherwise my mom would notice something wrong with my bill. That’s all today. Today is January 21st, 2017. I went to my grandpa’s home today as usual. I played Stellaris and found that I was not excited about it as yesterday. It turned out that I could not keep passion for this kind of strategy game for more than three days. The spirit of these hardcore gamers made me feel deep reverence for them. I watched Reply 1988. My grandpa asked me which university would I go. I told hime I was still waiting for the offer and it should not be a big problem. Please mail me the offer! I don’t want my family to be so nervous. I had video chat with Bun. She used her hand to make two meat ball on her face! Lol. That’s all today. Today is January 20th, 2017. I watched three films today. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Tropical Malady and Rebels of the Neon God. Apichatpong is fantastic. The structure and poetics of Tropical Malady, the relationship among the man, the tiger and the myth in the dark forest and the last scene of tiger on the tree are all incredibly impressive. Shooting ghost, monsters and the myth in a natural and peaceful way, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives used a line of Boonmee’s death to go directly to the deepest of Thai’s forest and cave. I don't know what’s wrong with those guy who regard Apichatpong’s films as bull shit. I think that must be the most pure aesthetics of film. A kind of mystical, oriental tone is extremely charming. There were two impressive scene in Rebels of the Neon God. The first one was that Kang pretended to be crazy but his dad recognize his trick and throw a bowl to him. The other one was that Kang jumped crazily but stroke the celling when hesaw Ze losing temper in front of his broken motorbike destroyed by himself. I wanted to play Stellaris with no reason at night. As a result I paid 90 yuan for it on steam without hesitation. I lied to my dad saying I bought a English Learning program. Lol. To be honest, at first I thought I could learn English from this game but this kind of thought always backfires. It looks really cool and has really great view. However it is still a world driven by technology. My wish to control the whole  world by magic is eliminated. That’s all today. Today is January 19th, 2017. I found two pieces of Bun’s sanitary towels in my bag in the morning. OMG. My mom said she was going to wash my bag in several days! Thank God I found it today. I went to Shanghai Biennial and found some interesting works and artists. The Great Chain of Being of China Academy of Fine Arts was cool but I thought it was overcomplicated. Yuan Sun and Yu Peng’s work was an emasculated version without trailers. Guoquan Ma and Love Letter of CANTONBON were interesting, too. I found a quite well artist called Pingyuan Lu today. He wrote a series of mystical short stories and displayed many places in the museum, which to some extent change the atmosphere of the whole exhibition. Extremely clever. In the context of museum and different reading way made these stories more interesting. Bun bought some snacks online and said part of them is the New Year gift for her grandma. Overall costed more than 200 yuan. I asked her if she wanted to buy something else. She said why I didn't blame her for buying too much and whether I did something bad to her secretly. I said because I could not accompany with her to celebrate the New Year. I watched Blissfully Yours tonight. Two paragraphs. The name and music appeared in the middle of the movie when characters drove to the mountain. Floating shining drawings, skin disease, river and forest were all extremely charming. Apichatpong becomes to be my No.1 asian director. That’s all today. Today is January 18th, 2017, the second day I come back home. I have been extremely lazy for a whole day. I heard that Gan Bi was the Chinese Apichatpong when I watched Kaili Blue and started to be curious about him. In addition I also found that he graduated from SAIC!  As a result I watched two of his films this afternoon, Mysterious Object At Noon and Syndromes and a Century. Fantastic. Narration, structure and frame combined with Thai mysticism, which is extremely charming. Bun said there was a new shopping mall opened near Nanhu. It was a highly automatic mall with a cinema on the top of it which was very convenient for us. At night Bun suddenly sent a screen shot of one of my Baidu Cloud account called “Tutou and Xiaoyin”. She asked me who was Xiaoyin. Damn it! She is a little girl who I liked unaccountably when I was in middle school. Why could she found this account which I abandoned for several years? I had to say it is a CP name of my WOW character and I was a little stupid boy at that time. The reason why I didn’t tell her the truth was that I didn’t want her to think too much and get angry due to this unaccountable reason. Moreover if she didn't mention it I would never ever remember that girl again. That’s all today. Today is January 17th, 2017, the first day I came back home. Lying and being lazy. Coooool. I watched Goodbye South, Goodbye and A City of Sadness. I made funny face at Bun at night though Facetime and she told me that I was as same as a retard. It’s amazingly cozy to do nothing but relax. I am a lazy man today. Haha. That’s all today. Today is January 16th, 2017. I came back home today! I met with Fangzhou at Beijing South Station and he bought me a cup of Starbucks. What a warm-hearted man he is! I watched All the Youthful Days on the express. Eventually, I could come back home with a relaxed mood. I talked with my grandparents after bath. I used to be offensive in such a situation but today I was really relaxed. They said I became mature. Sigh. I want to talk about it but I really don’t know what can I say. That’s weird. My dad got into a row with my grandma about the salary of our nanny. My grandparents seemed to be confused and my dad was extremely impatient. I was frightened by their quarrel. Worse, my dad was little bit drunk. I was afraid whether my grandma would be so angry that she become dizzy. Then my grandpa told my grandma let it go however she started to lose temper on my grandpa. Sigh. My grandparents had really got old. I really worried about senile dementia and I remembered my grandma again. I had video chat with Bun. She said Yunnan would go back home during the Chinese New Year. As a result she lose her friend who could accompany with her to celebrate the New Year. Sigh. Then she said a black square appeared on her screen. Fortunately, it disappeared after restarting. Finally I could have a nice sleep tonight! That’s all today. Today is January 15th, 2017. I will go back home tomorrow. I went to Indigo Mall with Bun today and had our dinner at KOTAROU Japanese Restaurant. Luckily, today is the last of discount on Agemono and each string costs only 1 yuan!  Ox Sinew with Tofu Soup was so delicious! We had a great meal and spent only 150 yuan. I remembered that the last time we spent at least 400 yuan here. I came back to my dorm after dinner to take my luggage. My luggage was completely full as a result I had to wear two overcoat together and put books and put some books and my razor in my pockets. I was pouring with swear when I came back my room. My glasses were covered by fog and I looked like a funny old man. Bun took a photo of me. My mom sent a picture of a desk of shaomai she made and asked me what I wanted to eat tomorrow. She also sent me some picture of my room tidied up by her. I found they put a extremely stupid drawing of my parents and me drawn by myself beside my bed. Awkward. We watched Shining tonight. The scene of the child riding in the hotel left a deep impress on me and the one of Wendy found out the truth of the novel of her husband scared me. Bun said she was almost frightened out but I didn’t think it was so terrifying generally. There are several details, however, I did not understand comprehensively. It is worth watching again. I would leave Bun tomorrow for 3 months. Sigh. When can we celebrate New Year together peacefully. That’s all today. Today is January 14th, 2017.  I ate udon noodles with Bun in Capitaland Mall at noon. She ate a kind of udon noodles put in a wood bowl. I took a picture of her when she revealed a kind of enchanted face. Then we went to Red Brick Museum to see Pulin Wen’s Archive of Chinese Avant-garde Arts. The high point of this exhibition focused on the exhibition called No U-turn happened in National Art Museum of China in 1989. I saw Dian Fan tried to persuade Yanguang Zhu to leave when he performed “Condolence” and Yanguang Zhu shouted, “Don’t touch me! I have legs!” I saw Xiantin Li cried in Da Tong Da Zhang’s retrospective exhibition. I saw the manuscript of Zuobingwei of Da Tong Da Zhang. I am so so regretful that I missed his retrospective exhibition last year at PSA. The reason why I didn't go upstair to visit this exhibition was I was tired after visiting Yongping Huang’s exhibition! How stupid I was. Sigh. I don’t know whether I still have opportunity to see Da Tong Da Zhang’s exhibition. He was definitely a heroic man. He lived like fire. I also saw a video that Bing Xu introduced his works in the 1980s. Lol. His sweater was so fashionable! What an exciting age it was! That kind of power and passion really impressed and touched me. We went to New World Mall to have our dinner at Green Tea. Cheap but delicious. Nice restaurant. Before we went to the cinema, we went to Watsons to buy Bun facial cleanser which costed 90 yuan. Then Bun saw a milk tea shop and wanted to buy a cup of milk tea. At first, I didn't agree because I thought we had spent too much money today already. Unfortunately, Bun had menstruation today and got angry immediately and said we should not go to watch movie any more. Sigh. I went downstair immediately and bought a cup of milk tea and a bottle of popcorn. When I came back I saw her was playing her phone and did’t looked so angry. We watched Hacksaw Ridge. Nice film. Wars are so terrible. I got a complex feeling and I don’t know how to say. There was not an intact sharing bike along the street in front of Fangheng Mall. I put the most serious curse on these guys who destroyed these sharing bikes. Finally we had to call an Uber to take us home. That’s all today. Today is January 13th, 2017. Finally, I finished my submitting of my portfolio. I went to the Internet cafe in the afternoon and submitted the final modified version. Thanks for Mary’s advice and adjustment! Actually I just clicked the mouse. The feel of ritual is eliminated by the information technology.  God bless me I can be admitted to SAIC! I received my academic report of the first semester. Thanks for all the faculty! Every parts of the report are “excellent” and the comment said they were looking forward to my work next semester. Although I know this report could not help my application but I really feel happy. Bun had seen off her friend and said she had stomach ache and wanted to go to IKEA to have hot coffee.  I went to Big Pizza with my roommates to celebrate our first semester. They played some drinking games. I said I should leave ahead of time to see my gf and played a drinking game first. I lost completely as a result I was forced to drink a half bottle of beer and eat a lot of pizza, which made my stomach nearly explode. Bun bought two bread with fry-dried meat floss from Master Bao. Really delicious. Bun said she wanted to buy a cool light which she wanted to buy yesterday. I didn't think we need a light as a result I refused. Bun kept talking about that light all over our way home. We watched American Honey at night and I fell asleep during it. It made me felt disgusted although MVB’s song appeared in the middle of it. That’s all today. Today is January 12th, 2017. Today I went to an Internet cafe to submit my portfolio and it was really effective. Why I didn't do that earlier? I also opened Heroes of The Storm and chatted with Shuai Wei. Bun’s emotion collapsed again at night. At first she said she went to have dinner with her friend and she paid for all the meals again. I asked her why her should pay for it by herself and why you can not share the cost. She told me her friend started to play her cell phone as soon as they finished eating and she was shy to ask her to pay so she went to pay it by herself. Bun does that every time. Her friends always played a bastard role profiting at her expense. I asked her should not be the one who is always the good man. It seemed to be too difficult for her. Then she told me that another of her friend told her that her last model and photos suck and invited her to fly to Chongqing to take photos of other beautiful models. Sigh. I really think Bun’s photos are not bad. To be honest most of them are really better than her peers’ boring ones. They could not all be the master pieces and I told her should be relaxed. I told her it was not problem for her to pass the exam. She said, however, she didn't care about other’s comments but she should make herself satisfied. If she could not find a proper model she could not take perfect photos. Sigh. She said I made her more anxious. Sigh. I was helpless. The only thing I could do is comfort her by sending messages. Luckily, she said there was a model she could shoot would come to Beijing several weeks later and she became happy immediately. She said she loved me and apologized for her emotionality. Sigh. I was like riding the roller coaster. To be honest, I am fine but I really don’t want Bun to be so emotional. That’s all today. Today is January 11th, 2017. I failed to submit my portfolio today. Many times it failed although it reached 100%, which made me really anxious. Bun told me that she had a dull ache in her arm. She asked me whether I hit her at night. Did she play a joke on me or she really believe that I hit her? I met with Tony at night. Other students showed a depressed face when they came out of Tony’s office and said Tony told them they should make their portfolio more interesting. However it seemed that Tony was interested in my works and had a good comment on my portfolio. I showed the video of Techno-mysticism to him and he regard it as a poetic action. Haha. He told me to be confident and artists like Nam June Paik and himself were my family member. In addition he told me to show what I want to show instead something showing skills. He told me to remove my realistic drawing and painting which were a kind of compromise. Thanks for Tony! He recommended On Kawara to me. At first he forget how to spell Kawara’s name and it costed a lot of time for him to find it out. The way he types is as same as the way he talks which is so slow and gentle that will make people anxious. Lol. He told me that my artist statement was a little bit arrogant which would make other teachers think I am a student who is hard to teach. He told me to change where I regarded myself as an artist. He said he would write a good recommendation for me. I didn't know whether he would do that but I was still happy. Bun’s old childhood friend came to Beijing. Bun sent a lot of self-made stickers of her face to me. They were really crazy and funny. Haha. That’s all today. Today is January 10th, 2017. Editing and rearranging my three video works. Finally I managed to reduce the length of these three from nearly half an hour to three minutes! What a genius I am. I received a message from the office which told me that I would have a conversation with Tony due to my IELTS score to help me to get higher scholarship. At first I thought there would be just few students had this opportunity but it turned out that there were at least 10 later. I did some recording today, which was an extremely awkward project! But I still need to finish that and submit it in order to make up the numbers. Bun went to take photo of her friend. She used a big luggage to put her items in the morning and she rode bike and pulled the luggage at the same time when I met with her at night! Her friends studied in Experimental Arts Department of CAFA and she told Bun a lot gossip of Experimental Arts Department. She said Zhijie Qiu had many mistresses in Hangzhou. One freshman girl invited Qiu to drink with her in a public Wechat  group, which made her be expelled from CAFA. She also regarded Second Elderly Bro as a big idiot because he made a work taking down a bike and sending its parts to Louvre. Lol. She said she didn’t want to get her master degree of Experimental Arts. Instead, she wanted to go to China Central Academy Of Drama to study stage art. That’s all today. Today is January 9th, 2017. This week is the last week of this semester and I should finished submitting my portfolio. Mary told me that my videos were still too long and should be cut to at most five minutes. The officer also told me to cut my artist statement to 500 words both for CCA and SAIC tonight. Damn it! Bun reserved a room for taking photo tomorrow which costed more than three hundred yuan. We went to the white to buy some supplies and props and by the way I brought a bag of bulbs I bought for my last project to her. She also asked me to bring her Ariel written by Sylvia Plath. She said she could get some inspiration from it for tomorrow’s photographing. We went to Shidu Noddles to have our dinner. Bun ordered noodles served with oil and she said it was not tasty as it used to be. As for me, I had never thought this restaurant was a good one. I came here almost for the quick WIFI. Bun told me not to go with her. I put a big bag of bulbs in the basket of the bike and saw her riding away staggeringly. I drew some sketches due to Jose’s suggestion. Oliver laughed at my trumpet’s perspective. That’s all today. Today is January 8th, 2017. We went to Zen Shun Luo to eat Men Ding meat pie. The restaurant is near South Luogu Alley which is on the street where MAO live house is. We ordered two meat pies at first. Incredible impressive. Then we ordered four pies and Braised Tofu. A little bit salty but still delicious and a little bit expensive. We left with two half-full stomaches. Bun saw there was a long queue in front of a spicy fish hot pot restaurant and said we must go to this restaurant in the future. Then we wondered near South Luogu Alley riding sharing bike. Bun kept saying she was hungry but we could not find a restaurant which seemed to be cheap as well as delicious. We kept wondering like two people who are under some spells(?) One roadside stand called Programmer Hot Hot Hot. Then we went to eat Ji Xiang wonton finally. I asked Bun whether she got angry. She said no and took several stupid photos of me which looked so ugly. Then we went to Gui Street and took the subway home. Today I had a kind of strange mood maybe caused by the smog? I don't know. I want to stay with my Bun and go to eat delicacy with her simply without any annoying things. That’s all today. Today is January 7th, 2017. There was extremely serious air pollution today. In the morning, I went to help Bun to pay for the enroll fee of the exams. It spent us a lot of time however I still could not pay for it successfully. What a fucking stupid paying system? Why could not it cooperate with Ali? Due to the interview with Jose in the afternoon about my portfolio, I had to come back to school first. Damn it! I became extremely anxious and fiery and Bun was in a bad mood, too. She said if I could not pay for it successfully she should give up the exams, which couldn't be allowed to happen. I found that I was still in a long queue as a result I backed to me dorm first and used Fushuai’s computer to make the payment. It turned out that the problem was the operating system and the paying system could not fit for my Mac. Jose told me that there were too many words but too few sketches in my portfolio which would make my portfolio hard to be understand. He suggested that I should draw more sketches and cut my words. To be honest, I really didn’t want to do that. Why could not others be a little bit professional? I believe in words and think words are the only way to make something clear. Little Dot came to Beijing. At first I didn’t want to meet with her due to so many tasks today. In the afternoon she told me that she was near my school with Lan and invited me to have dinner with them. I found it rude to refuse. We had dinner at Weilai. Lan kept complaining about City Design School and Little Dot complained her school during the meal. They asked me about my tuition of IFC. I said 150,000 yuan per year. They regarded me as a super wealthy boy. There was a boy sitting in front of us during the meal and he came to Lan and chatted and played with her. Little Dot asked Lan whether the boy was her boyfriend. Lan gave a very vague reply. Lan took school bus back to City Design School after dinner and I went a little way with Little Dot to the subway station. She told me that the reason why she came to Beijing is to transfer to Italy. She also told me that she was studying in an international program and would go to Bunka Fashion College two years later. Bun got depressed at night again. Sigh. I recommend a song called Champion to her in order to cheer her up. However this song’s value is far from hers, which made her become extremely anxious. I made a tremendous effort to relieve her successfully. Today’s bad weather should be blamed. That’s all today. Today is January 6th, 2017. I stayed up to study that mathematic program which was hard to use. To be honest, now I started to lose confidence in this project. I nodded off over desk around 8 o’clock and woke up and continued to typeset my slides one hour later. Little Dot asked me whether I would be free tomorrow. I didn't reply to her. I was extremely exhausted. Tomorrow I would have the interview with Jose about my slides and help Bun to enroll on the exams. Staying up is too overwhelming for me. I should go to bed as soon as class is over. That’s all today. Today is January 5th, 2017. Today I started to work on my slides. My works are too separated to some extent. The format is not quite beautiful. Please forgive me! My landlord asked me for the electricity and water bill. We should pay more than 600 yuan for the half year. FUCK. Bun and I could not use so much electricity and water. Landlord’s family used two air-conditioners in their rooms in summer but we just used two mini fans. Landlord’s mom could use the wash machine three times a day but we just use it twice a week. SON OF A BITCH. Why we should go fifty-fifty with him? FUCK YOU. YOU landlord is a FUCKING BASTARD. I will never ever rent a house or a room in Beijing anymore in the future. I wanted to redo Interpretation of Time in the Space Coordinates System when I was working on my slides. The installation sucks. The original idea was completely abstract and conceptual so why should I make it practical? I downloaded a mathematic program and wanted to use it to make a video. However I still thought it was not so good after careful thinking. Actually the words are the best way to present the idea. But I still should make a new one because that installation is extremely stupid. Bun did some questions of BFA’s exams which were extremely hard. I asked her whether she should go to some cramming classes for BFA’s exam. She said she would consider about it. Sigh. To be honest, the tuition is too prohibitive for us. How can I get so much money! Even Yun Ma cannot help me anymore. Sigh. I should not think about that. In the end thing will mend. Tomorrow I should submit my semester dossier as a result tonight I had to stay up to work both on my dossier and slides. That’s all today. Today is January 4th, 2017. Today I started to prepare my semester dossier and slideroom.  Jose gave a lecture about the format and graphic design of the semester dossier and slides. David talked about the interview and invited a Chinese teacher called Jackie to give us some advice. I don’t know why I feel the way Jackie talks is strange but funny.  I went to Carrefour with Bun at night. We ate at Xiabu. I ordered the mutton soup base which is the new product. That was the first time I thought white radish was not so bad. There was a stupid pink hat on the shelf. I tried it and Bun took a picture of me. I thought that photo was the best one of my image recently. Lol. Bun bought expensive shampoo and toothpaste. At first I didn’t think they were worth that money and didn't want to buy but finally I compromised on that. She asked me to buy the same toothpaste. I lied to her that I still had a lot and I didn't need it. I asked her where was the difference. She told me that if I use highly quality one I will fall in love with brushing my teeth. I went back to my dorm after sent Bun to home. I looked at my painting. Sucks. I should give up it. That’s all today. Today is January 3rd, 2017. Today is critique day. The critique was not  as good as I imagined before. I talked a lot in order to lead the discussion to a deep meaning of my work but teachers kept taking about about practical operation and paid no attention to what i want them to notice! Sigh. Catherine praised me for my statement at the end of critique which made me feel a little bit better. There still was someone notice what I want to express. Then I stole a glance at the scores given by several teachers which seemed to be fine. I listened to Oliver’s critique. Everyone made a extremely high comment on his animation. I peeked at Mary’s grade board. 98! OMG. I even felt jealous of Oliver. But to be honest, his animation was definitely well-done in both technique and idea. Sigh. I always thought I would not so care about these scores. Actually I could not get rid of them. I felt tired. Maybe I gave the critique too much expectation. This project was completely finished today and I felt lost with no reason. That’s all today. Today is January 2nd, 2017. I received a strange location sharing marked as a overpass and a extremely weird photo of a blue image of me from Bun, which frightened me out of my mind. I called her immediately. She told me she was still sleeping in a vague voice. Around 11 o’clock she got up and sent a message to me said that she was just kidding me. We ordered fried beef rice noodles as our lunch which were extremely disaster. I wrote the statement for tomorrow’s critique. Wish tomorrow’s critique can be successful because this semester’s score depends on that. That’s all today. Today is January 1st, 2017. Happy new year! The first day of 2017 is shrouded in thick haze. I bought Bun some fruit and went to school to prepare my final critique. The sculptures in the campus were wearing the masks. Unfortunately, there was no one documented my performance the day before yesterday. As a result I should perform my project again and documented it by myself. My MacBook didn’t break down this time. I guess the reason was that this time I was not so sincere. After documenting I used the public projector to watch A One and a Two. Fantastic movie. Start with a wedding and end with a funeral. There is the essence of life here, but it is beyond my words. Edward Yang is a great film maker. Athy asked me for borrowing a charge during the movie. Then I went to print some materials for the critique and backed to my dorm doing some editing job. Suddenly I found that I left Anglo’s high-class camera in the studio! I called him immediately to tell him to take it in case someone steals it. However, he was very calm and told me not to be anxious and that’s would be fine and nobody would steal it. Why can he not feel nervous and afraid? I started a painting at night but I found that I could not go into it any more. That’s all today. Today is 31st December, 2016. I woke up at 10 o’clock and went to meet with Bun. I saw her new mobile phone. She showed her S7’s special functions and features. I peeked at her screen and found there was a game called The Yin Yang Master. She told me that she was eager for it long time ago. She had download it several times but she could not play because her old phone could not run this game. We went to supermarket to buy ingredients for tonight’s hot pot. We bought prawns and streaky pork which we were always reluctant to buy due to the expense. We watched different New Year Eve galas and had our dinner. Jike Zhang’s clothes were hilariously funny. Lol. We ate pumpkin soup cooked by Bun yesterday after the hot pot. Delicious. But the chestnut sauce was not so good so we didn’t add it to the soup. Bun said she want to wait to see Fei Wang’s singing. She started to play The Yin Yang Master and I sent several “Happy New Year” messages to my friends. I remembered today of last year. It costed me six hours to walk from Nanhu to Beijing South Railway Station. I lied on the street and listened to Last Winter In Beijing. I stayed up in a internet cafe near Beijing South Railway Station and watched Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Tangerine. I had my breakfast at Yonghe King and took a pill with sleepiness on the railway. 2017 is Bun’s year of fate. I wish we can have a smooth year. Faye Wong finished her song and the sound of fireworks appeared. Happy New Year! That’s all today. Today is 30th December, 2017. The performance of Techno-mysticism was finished successfully today. At first I thought there was nobody would come to see it. However it turned out that the classroom was thronged with people, which made me a little bit nervous and flustered. To be honest I hadn’t rehearsed it completely before I started. Fortunately, the final effect was pretty good and Mary shook hand with me in a very formal way and said congratulation to me. Lol. The teacher who taught graphic design, Jose, met me in the hall and told me my work is a really good art piece. After the performance, my MacBook broke down in a dramatic way suddenly. I had never seen the product of Apple broke down in that way. I was, however, a little bit excited and happy. Although I know the reason should be that I didn’t cut the wire of the projector in a correct way, I tried to regard this as a kind of success in communicating with the Heaven. I realized that there were still a lot of things I could do to make some parts be closer to their essence in order to make this project perfect. But I am still very satisfied with what I have did for now and thanks for Mo’s help. I received my IELTS’s score at noon. Overall 7.5. Awesome! I am proud of myself and give myself a clap. Lol. Today is a happy day and a good end of 2016. Bun told me that her new phone was arrived. I was extremely exhausted today. I stayed up last night and reached my physical limitation. In these five days I had backed to my dorm just once. That’s all today. Today is 29th December, 2017. Today is the last day for preparation. I stayed up last night to complete the background music. I bent over the desk and fell asleep at nearly six o’clock for two hours. I gave some cash to Bun at night. I lay on the bed and Bun was beside me. I stared at the street lamp dreamily and felt I become extremely transparent and I could float into the air. I could communicate with the stars which are only in the image level. At that time I felt like I having nothing to do. However, technically, I have a whole room should be decorated. Bun asked me if I need her help. I said no. Then she asked me whether I thought she would make me embarrassed if she came to my school. I was shocked. I didn’t know why did she regard me as that kind of people. These couple days I had a lot of things to do. I cried on my way to my school. It seemed like that I could see the stars today although I remembered that today’s air pollution was serious during the daytime. I realized that I had much more tasks to do than I imagined. Mainly the fourteen bulbs are hard to hang and the yellow paper is too fragile. Even the wind caused by people’s passing would break it down. The projector I bought on Taobao was totally rubbish. I had to borrow two from the office tomorrow. I almost drink the glue as my Wahaha. This is the final busy night, which is also nice for me to be too busy and exhausted to be nervous about the IELTS’s score which would be published tomorrow. That’s all today. Today is 28th December, 2016. Bun’s cell phone broke down completely. It could not be charged and was power off in this afternoon. I will be extremely anxious if I can not keep in touch with her and have no idea about my work. As a result I went to her and she said she want to buy a samsung s7. Damn it! Why did the cell phone break down at that time? I am really really not a child raised by a wealthy family. I only dare to have one meal every day and try my best not to use cash to purchase nearly everything I want, which can afford two people’s living expenses. I borrowed money and to afford her tuition however it seems like there wouldn’t be a good result this year. I still should worry about the tuition, living expenses and house rent next year. I nearly reached my limitation this afternoon. I could not help crying and asked her if she could call her dad for help. Expectably, she lost her temper. She said I would never understand her and told me never mention her dad who beat her with chair and belt and insulted her when he was drunk. She asked me to buy her a ticket to go home. I could not hear “I should go home” these four words from her mouse. What could I do? I don’t how to describe our relationship and what will it be. It is the most unpredictable future in my life. I borrowed 3,000 yuan and I could pay back the money by installment in six months. I wish it can be delivered as soon as possible. Strangely, I felt extremely relaxed after purchasing it. It might not be a big deal in my life. I ordered a takeaway for Bun before I backed to school. Today’s weather is nice. Both the way I came and returned is filled with fresh air. At first I thought I will lose contact with Bun today however she sent me a message at night and told me Ziyi lend his iPad to her. Ziyi is a really nice friend. I still have a lot of works to do. I think I will stay up again. That’s all today. Today is 27th December, 2016. I made Bun angry again. I called her at noon and she told me her tea cup was broken completely and she could not drink water any more. I said you could use bowl to drink for temporary. She asked why she could not buy a real cup to drink water. I told she maybe we could wait for several days. Sigh. I just want to try to save money! Why could not make do with a bowl? I am exhausted due to the final and I really had no energy to worry about else things like that! Maybe my tone was not so good, which made she lose the temper. She asked me how dare I blame on her and said this cup’s crack was caused by my mistake of pouring boiled water into it. Then she ignored my calls and messages. Damn it. I went to buy her a new cup after school immediately. At first I wanted to go to IKEA but there was no Gong tea here so I had to go to Taiyanggong. The tea cup sold in the Carrefour costed me 20 yuan! Unbelievably expensive. Then I went to buy a cup a Gong tea and went to tous les jours to buy Bun some cakes and doughnuts. Bun asked me why I bought that green cup. I said your last one is green. She said it was the same green as that one. This new one’s green was ugly. I went back to school to work on the background music. I wanted to have a good sleep today so I backed to my dorm today but I still stayed up until 3 am. Before I went to bed Bun told me her cell phone could not be charged. I said let buy a new but cheap one to transit. To be honest, however, I don't think she would choose a cheap one to make do. Sigh. Exhausted. I posted a Weibo nearly 3 o’clock and Athy left me a message said why did not you sleep. That’s all today. Today is 26th December, 2017. Today’s weather is pretty well. I started to edit my video. I bought pirated Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro on Taobao. The seller of Final Cut Pro sold an app store account to me and let me download the program directly from app store. Unbelievable method. I went to Bun in the afternoon. The Wi-Fi in my school sucks. As a result, I went to Bun. She asked me why did you have time to meet me. When she saw I used my MacBook and downloaded the programs she said you just come for Wi-Fi not for me. We ordered Nanjing Impressions. Fermented glutinous rice was incredibly amazing. Diguo chicken was much more delicious than the last time we ate at the restaurant. In addition, it costed us only 40 yuan! That’s all today. Today is 25th December, 2016. Today is Christmas! We went to Baiyun temple to collect the materials for my final project. We bought some cookies and cakes before we took the bus. Today’s weather was not very good at first but became a little bit better couple hours later. We saw the notice about the new year ceremony. Bun was born in the Rooster year and the new year will be her second animal year. The notice said this year the people who was born in the Rooster year would make Taisui which meant they would got bad luck for the whole year. I asked Bun if she want to participate in the new year ceremony which might help her to get lucky. But we found that the enrollment fee would cost more than 500 yuan! Bun said she was a little bit afraid and should she buy a fortune bag. But finally we found it was not worth that money so we left the shop. The temple offer incense freely. The way Bun burnt her incense was extremely professional but I am wondered what were we looking forward to by this kind of action. Luckily, today there was a ceremony happening. I used my recording pen to record the most audio part of the ceremony. At first I was afraid whether my behavior was too offensive until I found a lot of people used their phone to take a video. Some taoists wearing traditional robes played their phones, which was a very strange image. After leaving the temple, I saw the fortune teller who talked with me last time and I pulled Bun and ran immediately. But we were still caught by another fortune teller. She said Bun has a lucky face for her husband. Lol. We took the subway to Taiyanggong at night. At first we wanted to save money but then we realized that today is Christmas day! As a result we went to eat pizza. After backing home, I bought Bun 200 yuan items for her next photograph project. Wish her can have a happy shot. That’s all today. Today is 24th December, 2017. Bun said she wanted to buy some props and clothes for her photograph project so we want to Dahongmen in the morning. The atmosphere here made us almost suffocate, which was as same as the situation that we were at Weiduoli plaza in Huhehaote. We bought a package of sticky candy at the entrance of the supplementary material market. It tasted really nice however when we want to buy more we could not found the seller again. I made the recording of the sound of the subway and then I went back to school to take my speaker. Then I started to edit the sound and suddenly I became a little bit anxious and disturbed and want to give up this performance. We sat on the bed and watched Train to Busan. Bun cried again. I told Bun I was anxious and Bun comforted me. Finally I decided to carry out it. We took a taxi to Jiangtai station. Two foreigner asked me the way to a hotel when I backed up the speaker. Then I started and Bun chased me and took the video of my performance. Unfortunately, I went wrong way! Damn it! So we must separated the performance into two part. We went bikes to get to the correct routine and continued. I was extremely concentrated during the performance but I found that nearly no one paid attention to me, which made me a little bit frustrated. I didn’t know what could my performance generate. I finished this performance after one hour waking in the cold wind. Both Bun and I were cold, exhausted and hungry. As a result we went to eat barbecue near the Wangjing station before we went back home. I got a little bit happy when I watched the video taken today although I felt empty and desolated during the performance. Thanks for my Bun. That’s all today. Today is 23rd December, 2016. I started to draw the charms today. Andrew asked me why did I use the screen shot and said it seemed like some online drawing courses. At very beginning, I was stuck to this idea because I thought it made the action, “drawing”, more outstanding. Andrew suggested me that I should use the way how to make the animation to make a video. I thought it made the video more like an animation although I pretended to accept his advice at first. However I found the effect of it was quite well with the background sound. This is a extremely time-consuming work and the first one costed me nearly one hour. There are twelve charms should be finished by Monday morning’s presentation. That’s all today. Today is 22nd December, 2016. I tried to carry out my recording project but I found the effect was not so good and I thought I would not continue this idea. Mary asked me whether did I go to the field trip. Actually, I am not so interested in the field trip and I don’t think it will help me a lot. I told her I would go in this afternoon. Unfortunately, it costed too much time to wait for the bus, which made me miss the opening time of Baiyun temple. There were many fortune telling shop near the temple. A fortune teller woman tried to force me to listen to her so I stopped to hear. She told me my forehead was big which meant I was too kind so I should not be involve in politic. In addition, I was too clear about anything so I was so easy to be hurt. She suggested me that I should not make friends with the people who was in the same profession with me. Moreover, she mentioned that I should be careful that someone who was close to me would utilize me. … . Finally she told me to go to her shop and do some deeper prediction which must charge a lot. I refused her an left. The weather became much better this afternoon, which made me become happy. I saw a Qingfeng Bun restaurant and had my dinner here. Then I took the subway to go back to my school. I inspect the ground near the south gate and I found it would be extremely difficult to carry out my performance. Maybe I need some other ways. That’s all today. Today is 21st December, 2016. The Winter Solstice. Today’s air pollution is extremely serious. At first I planned to join the KTV party organized by IFC and than I left in advance to eat dumplings with Bun. After the lecture I took a nap in the afternoon and when I woke up Bun send a message to me to ask me to meet her in One Way Street bookstore. I found that I have no time to go to the KTV. Compared with KTV, Bun is much more important for me. One Way Street bookstore (Huajiadi) is located near B&W studio. There was an air cleaner which helped a lot. Bun was reading a book, Beauty and Wildness, and kept saying Gangjian Qiu was genius. Then we rode to eat dumplings at Weixiangyuan Dumpling House. The restaurant was full of people today due to the winter solstice. We ordered two portions of dumplings and Fish in Sour Soup. Not so good. The wrappers of the dumplings were mashed. The restaurant was extremely noisy and there was a anxious woman speak loudly to press waitress to serve her without considering today’s special situation. I remembered the winter solstice last year, Bun, Rui Niu, Brother Jun, Yang Zhao and I ate dumplings here and the dumplings were terrible, too. My mom asked me whether did I went to the KTV. She must saw some pictures of the KTV in the IFC parent’s WeChat group. I lied to her saying that I was sick so I didn’t go there. I saw Oliver singing Jay Chou’s songs in Moments perfectly. I wanted to go to sing, too. I have a nice sound, too. That’s all today. Today is 20th December, 2017. I bought a lot of things for my final project on Taobao this morning. It was a large sum of money and I still worry about the quality of the cheap projector. I could only find if it can work until I get it. I went to Wangjing Soho with Bun to watch movie at night. We saw a street seller who was selling bargains. We bought some biscuits and nori. Bun bought some Star Ball Cups which I had thought it was a kind of import expensive snacks in the past in Wumei market. Then we went to have our dinner at B1 in Wangjing Soho. I ordered fried rice and Bun ordered some fried dumplings. Then we went to the cinema and Bun became anxious about her future of the university again during waiting for the movie starting. She communicated with a cramming education organization for BFA and it charged a lot. Sigh. We watched The Wasted Times. Not bad. After the movie, we felt hungry and went to 711. I bought a box of rice and Bun bought instant noodles and some crisps. I grilled some sausages at home and ate them with rice. Incredible delicious! That’s all today. Today is 19th December, 2017, the first studio day after IELTS. I didn’t whether it was a dream or just my unconsciousness during my last night sleep. I found that i got inspiration as soon as I woke up in the morning, which was as same as the situation that I managed to solve a difficult maths problem in my dream when I prepared for my senior middle school entrance examination. Then I finished my plan and drew several sketches quickly before I went to class. I had a nice and smooth conversation with Mary. However Mary said what i am going to do maybe make some believers feel offended. I still have a lot of details should be considered and how to present the process of the charm drawing is a big problem. I started to study “China Charm and Spell Culture Study” to collect some inspiration. I used Google Translation to speak out several spells from the book and the effect was incredibly amazing. Bun went to Minzu University of China to meet with Rui Niu and Piao. She told me she lost her way on her way home and rode onto a viaduct. Finally, she stared at the neon light board, “City Moonlight”, and follow the light to find the way home. Beijing is oppressive at night. It isn’t my home. That’s all today. Today is 18th December, 2017. Finally, IELTS is over today. I finished my speaking test this morning and my examiner was a white old lady. She was a nice lady wearing an exaggerative make-up. The whole process was quite smooth. Part two was about the people who had an deep influence on me. Although I had not prepare for this specific topic but I had prepared for something similar. Thank goodness. Part three was a little bit harsh for me but finally I did it. The examiner lady looked very kind and I wished she was kind intrinsically, too. After the test I rode bike home, which spent me at least one hour and exhausted me a little bit. The road situation around Quaternion Bridge was extremely complicated, which made me lost my way again. Bun was still sleeping when I arrived at home. I tried to wake her up but finally I failed. She gave me her green jacket and I left my black cotton-padded jacket. She said it was too dirty and she would help me to wash it. Then we went to Taiyanggong. Today is a relaxing day. Both Bun and I were in good mood. I will start full studio class tomorrow and get to work on my final application. I remembered that I should prepare at least five sketches for tomorrow’s meeting but I still had no idea about my final project. It is weird that I am not so worried about that although it will be due in eight hours. That's all today. Today is 17th December, 2016, the first day of IELTS. It was cold in the morning and I took a taxi to the examination site with my roommates. The exam was not so difficult. The listening and reading were both quite smooth for me. There were several problems in my writing. I realized there was a plural form mistake in my first sentence. Damn it! I had my lunch at Adaxi with Ben and Oliver. There were only little chicken in Big Plate Chicken. After a nap I went to studio to continue prepare for tomorrow speaking test. I practiced several topics with Ben and then I suddenly felt a little bit lost. Immediately, I felt extremely bad with no clear reason. I wandered on the 3rd floor of the No.7 building alone. I called Bun on my way to my dorm. I was cheered up by seeing my roommates. It turned out that, indeed, being alone would cause depression. Finally, I still just have prepared half of the topics so far. God bless me meet a nice and kind examiner. I still need to prepare for a while. That’s all today. Today is 16th December, 2016, the last English studying day before IELTS exam. I had the listening class in the morning and Sherry gave us some advices and told us her experience of the listening exam again. God bless me get more than 7.5 in the listening part. The writing class was in the afternoon. Adam talked about a lot of things today in class. However, today is the first day we were taught about how to describe a flow chart or a map. We have no time to practice as a result it is actually useless for us. If we meet with these two kinds of topic, we are going to fail definitely. We could only depend on luck. I had my dinner at McDonald. I ate the new product called star chief  hamburger. A little bit expensive but it was worth that. I met with Sailing boy and Fangzhou during my dinner. At first, I planned to go to bed earlier tonight. I lied on the bed and browsed my photos on my phone. I saw a photo of Bun and she was smiling, making a “V” gesture happily. With no reason, I couldn't help crying. I missed her so much tonight. I love her. Then I found that I could not fall asleep so early due to my biological clock so I did some review about writing and vocabulary. Then I chatted with my roommates for a while. I should get up at 6 o’clock tomorrow morning. That’s all today. Today is 15th December, 2016. We had our speaking class at 7 o’clock in the morning today. However, it was still useless because it was impossible for us to prepare for more than 20 new topics. Nothing to say about Gary. I got some hot water and wanted to make it cold so I didn’t close the cap. Unfortunately, it poured out. Awkward. These topics I had never met before this class and I had completely no idea about them and could say nothing. If I got such kind of topic I had to go die. I still have nearly 20 topics should be prepared. For god sake, I have only three day left. The reading class in the afternoon was boring and Beatrice just told us some normal tips. Bun said she wanted to buy a scale and said she want to lose weight. Although I knew that she was just talking and would never do, I still bought one. My dad sent me a message told me should not be busy reviewing when I was revising for my speaking topics. He said “The outcome is a foregone conclusion.” I told Bun and she said my dad was right. That’s all today.Today is 14th December, 2016. We had speaking class in the morning and Gary still talked about some useless strategies. I got 7.5 in the test in listening class this afternoon. At first I thought my score definitely would be around 6. However, it turned out that my score was the highest one in my class.Wish i could keep this score in my actual exam. My packaged arrived during listening class so I left class pretending to go to the toilet. However I met with the office teachers in campus. Awkward. Luckily, they seemed to be not realize that this was the class time. I brought “Invisible Cities” to Bun at night. We went to have our dinner around Capitaland Mall. We bought some jujubes and roasted yams at the newly-opened shop. Then we had our dinner at a Hong kong style restaurant. I ordered Roasted Duck Rice and Bun ate pho. Cheap but not so tasty and the amount was quite small. Then we rode back home. Today’s moon was so big and bright. I came back to school to continue preparing my speaking topics. That’s all today. Today is 13th December, 2016. Some students took their speaking test today. I heard that there were various kinds of examiners and they could determine your behavior to a great extent. Yoda told us that the examiner he met was a disaster. Plus, I heard about several very strange stupid topics which I had never practiced. Beatrice recommend an app to us called IELTS Bro. There are all topics including part one to three. Damn it! Why did not Gary give us all the topic until this last week? What’s wrong with him?! I practice the mock speaking test with Ben after day class. Ben is so free and smooth to talk drivel! To be honest, at first I was not like him due to this point. But maybe now I am get used to him and I felt more comfortable with him. Bun said she was so cold due to some cracks on the wall. In addition, it seemed that she didn't want to buy a cheap one just to make do. Sigh. Why did this year’s heater so weak? It is December now. Maybe it is our fault because we put the dest in front of our heater. Although I didn’t want to spent money, I didn't want my Bun feel bad. That’s all today. Today is 12th December, 2016. The last English studying week before IELTS exam began. I went to Taiyanggong Capitaland Mall with Bun at night. Bun said Gong Tea was a kind of fantastic drink so I bought one cup. Indeed, it’s extremely wonderful. We could not decide which restaurant could we go. Finally, we found that Hannashan was much cheaper than other small Korean restaurant. I ordered Bibimbap and Bun ate Miso Soup with rice. It costed us only 50 yuan. This was a Korean BBQ restaurant actually so all people in this restaurant ordered grilled meat. Bun and I could only bear our desire for meat. After dinner, Bun backed home and I went to school to continue preparing for IELTS. I found something strange. Someone posts a picture with me coincidentally and attached one sentence, “My ex-boyfriend and I”. I bought some books for my project and one for Bun. That’s all today. Today is 11th December, 2016. I worked on my speaking topics in the morning and completed one set of reading test in the afternoon. I only made three mistakes in this test! Can u believe that! I thought that I had found the key to IELTS reading test. Bun started to blame herself again. Sigh. Every time she does that I will feel bad, too. The only thing I could do is to pretend to be fine and try to say something to comfort her. But I know those could not really solve her problem completely. The only thing could help is herself. Oliver will have his speaking test in two days so he was preparing at night. Fushuai was extremely crazy and excited tonight. He climbed onto Oliver’s bed and made fun with him. Plus, he said a strange alien language and made some weird noise at the same time. This is exactly what Chinese college dormitory culture is. There is a kind of magic atmosphere which can make people relaxed and warm all the time. Although Fushuai became too crazy and made Oliver angry yelled at him once, the atmosphere here backed to warm and joyful again quickly. That’s all today. Today is 10th December, 2016, Saturday. Air pollution is extremely heavy and Bun is still suffering from headache. We continued to watch I Wish this morning. We went to Carrefour at noon. We passed tous les jours and saw some chocolate doughnuts here. I said we could bought some after our lunch however we forgot about it. We went to Domino's Pizza. Today there was a huge discount: buy one pizza get one free. This was the first time I ate pizza at Domino’s Pizza. Not bad and cheap. However both Bun and I became depressed after lunch without any reason. Maybe it is the bad weather caused bad mood. Bun still had headache and I was so worried about her. At first, due to IELTS exam next week I was going to back to school to review but I was so worried about Bun that I didn’t want to leave her alone. Sigh. She refused me and said I should back to school to study and she will go to Huaqing Studio to get her deposit back. I watched her leaving and felt extremely bad. That’s all today. Today is 9th December, 2016. I had reading class in the morning. I went to Huandao to meet with Bun. Bun was wearing her green pilot jacket today. We had our lunch at Adaxi. We ordered Big Plate Chicken with noodles and one naan. The naan was amazingly delicious. After lunch Bun went to Sanyuanli market to do her photograph project and I came back to school for my writing class. After class I went to Carrefour to have dinner with Bun. We ate hot pot at Xiabuxiabu. Today we ordered too much again. Every time we went to Xiabu we must get the “drunk” feeling. We watched Hirokazu Koreeda when we came back home. Today’s film was I Wish. We sat on the bed closely and gradually we became sleepy. We were too sleepy to continue watching it. So we decide to pause and continue tomorrow. That’s all today. Today is 8th December, 2016. The melon seeds I bought yesterday were incredibly tasty! I ate them all day long even during the class. From listening class to writing class, my mouth didn’t stop for a second. I grabbed a paper cup that someone left in the classroom. I shared with Ben and we sat together eating melon seeds secretly. At first I was worried if Sherry or Adam would get angry because this seemed to be impolite. It turned out that they were fine with melon seeds and I was so sophisticated that I could keep silence when I eating melon seeds. I got only 6.5 in the mock listening test. Sigh. There is only one week left. I didn't know if I could make progress in the last one week. After class the office teacher gave us a speech about the application of UAL. The process was extremely complicated and troublesome, which made me want to give up UAL. That's all today. Today is 7th December, 2016. At first I wasn’t going to meet with Bun until next weekend. However I had no homework and Bun said she got some new from her studio. So I went to meet with her after my class. Bun told me that Sheng Yang comforted her in the afternoon and said he would help Bun to get a part of tuition back. She also told me that a lot of her classmates came to comfort her too and someone said maybe she could try to enroll on other province’s college entrance examination. Although I know it was impossible to neither get the tuition back nor enroll on other examination at that moment, their kindness really do help Bun a lot to get rid of the bad mood. I went to Capitaland Mall by bus and found there was a new shop selling pan-fried seeds and nuts which was many people in queue. I tried that caramel melon seeds. Incredible impressive. So we bought some melon seeds and roasted yams. The yams were cold so were not so tasty. Then we went to BHG to buy some instant noodles and bought Bun a cup of soya milk before we backed home. We cooked some sausages and baked some bread for our dinner. I saw the picture Bun shot yesterday. Her friend was so photogenic. We wanted to watch that documentary of Guoqiang Cai however after using vpn and registering on Netflix we still had no access to watch it. Damn it. That’s all today. Today is 6th December, 2016. I checked the answers of the listening test and it turned out that I did a quite good job yesterday. Fortunately, Ziyi still slept overnight at our home. Some friends staying with her could definitely cheer her up. Plus, her best friend came to Beijing tonight and she told me that he was a very “professional” model and she took some pictures of him. She told me that she took some really good photos tonight. It’s really helpful for her to do something, which could help her get rid of depression at that moment. I asked her if she contacted with her studio class. She said she was not ready for it and she would do it several days later. That’s all today. Today is 5th December, 2016, the first day of IELTS fortnight. We had the mock examination in the morning. During the examination, I felt quite tough and difficult and the time was not enough. But during the reading class in the afternoon, after Beatrice analyzed this exam and gave us the answers, I found it wasn’t so difficult as I thought in the morning. Beatrice also said this time would not give us the results and we could know our score by ourselves. I estimate that I could get nearly 7 in my reading test. Ziyi still stayed with Bun today, which made I feel relieved. Bun said she and Ziyi went to Xinyixinxiang studio. Ziyi rented a room for 2300 per month from me last year landlord. One major bedroom without any furniture except for a bed. That’s all today. Today is 4th December, 2016. We woke up at ten o’clock as every normal day. We did some research on some art school which don’t need her art score. However, it seemed like that we ignored some details on purpose. Maybe we do know that this year’s study was over. Indeed, we could not brace up so easily. We ordered Hainan steamed chicken and rice as our lunch. We ordered one portion of chicken and two portions of rice. The amount is really small but taste was not bad. Bun said it is the best Hainan steamed chicken and rice she had ever eaten. Bun arrived in Beijing in the afternoon and said he would spent a night in our room. We went out in the afternoon. I went to school to bring Bun my camera and Bun went to white house to meet with Ziyi and Changchang. They went to ate Beijing Roast Duck for dinner. It did help Bun get rid of bad mood. Tomorrow is the first day of IELTS fortnight and I have the mock exam in the morning. If there was no one to accompany with Bun, I could not leave her alone and focus on reviewing. Fortunately, Ziyi could chat with Bun. Finally I could back to school and do some reviewing. That’s all today. </p>
